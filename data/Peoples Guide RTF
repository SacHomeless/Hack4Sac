People’s Guide to
HEALTH, WELFARE AND OTHER SERVICES
SACRAMENTO COUNTY



The People’s Guide is a practical self-advocacy information guide and directory on how to get food, income, jobs and training, housing, health and dental care, legal advice, and other important help from local, state and federal programs and community services in Sacramento County.
We don’t need to tell you these are hard times!  Foreclosures, high unemployment, homelessness on the rise and the city, county, state and federal budgets either eliminating or making deep cuts to most of the programs talked about in this guide. 
These cuts mean less help for low-income individuals, families, seniors and homeless people to access the these life-saving programs.  It means reduced benefits, fewer workers, tighter eligibility rules, long lines and longer waits.  
It also means rumors and false information that discourage eligible people from applying for a desperately needed program and people not knowing where or how to apply.
The Sacramento Housing Alliance [SHA] and the Sacramento Hunger Coalition [SHC]  believes that every person has the right to healthy food, safe, decent and affordable housing and healthcare.  Help in Hard Times not only is a self-advocacy guide to these programs, but also gives you advice on what you can do if your are treated unfairly or do not receive what you are entitled to by law.  The guide is dedicated to helping all people overcome barriers when they are trying to get help.
You do not need to read the entire book; just find the topic in the table of contents.  But, remember, that if you are eligible for one kind of help, you often qualify for other programs.
You can also help!
1. Share this information with other people who need help;
2. Share your voice:  Elected officials in Sacramento City, County, State Capitol and Washington, DC are always debating the programs and services described in this guide.  Especially during hard times, there is conflict about the money for these services.  Too often the programs described in this guide are eliminated or cut severely.
Your voice is needed in these debates!  You are an expert on what happens to people’s lives when they can’t get food, money, housing or health care.  Government officials need to hear your authentic voice and remind them of how these programs help or don’t help what your problems or solutions are.
Politicians often use the money for other things than education, health, welfare and social services.  But, when the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the gap has very bad effects on our entire society.   You can help close that gap.
3. To get names and address of your local, state and federal elected officials call                                 	 (916) 875-6451

Persons Experiencing Homelessness
Many people experience homelessness in a variety of ways–sometimes in a tent, other times in the home of a friend or family member. In Sacramento, as in most cities, there are not enough emergency shelter beds for every person that is homeless on any given night.  In the past, most bouts of homelessness did not extend past a week up to a several months, but this situation may be changing due to Sacramento County’s budget problems.  If you find yourself homeless without previous preparation, this section will help you until you are able to access shelter or housing.
Remember that many that find themselves homeless might not be so different from yourself, so there is a great resource by peer support and advice. A great starting point would be a service provider like Loaves & Fishes. You can contact them at (916) 446-0874.



Keep from freezing – cardboard is a great insulator from the cold ground and provides some cushion when sleeping on cement.  If you don’t have a tent, a tarp is a must for camping gear, and a warm sleeping bag. 
Sometimes sleeping bags are available at Loaves & Fishes’ Friendship Park at 1 PM by the service center. You may also be able to obtain coats and rain gear. Friendship Park also provides activities, information, restroom facilities and a safe environment while you access services. The center is located at 1321 North C Street.
Staying dry – If you have a tent, make sure it has a rain fly or secure one tarp over the tent and one under the tent. If you do not have a tent, a tarp is very important when living outdoors. Finding a place to sleep under cover is sometimes hard to find, but many sleep communally under freeways during rain storms. Sleeping in doorways of businesses that have gone out of business is a good place to sleep out of the rain.  You can use trash bags for raincoats by cutting out holes for your head and arms. Check for sprinkler systems. 
Safe Ground Sacramento is a good resource if you must sleep outdoors and would like to camp amongst others in a drug, alcohol and violence free environment. Safe Ground Sacramento are organizing to acquire land and simple cottages, but meanwhile members just camp together and support each other, sometimes being hosted by a church to sleep indoors on some cold nights. Often they can provide camping equipment and other supplies when you stay with them.  Office is located in Loaves & Fishes Friendship Park at 1321 North C Street. (916) 448-2448.
Keeping cool – keep wet towel or something wet around neck or over head. Drink lots of water to stay hydrated. Avoid alcohol drinks because they dehydrate. 
Wildlife – Skunks, raccoons, possums, and rats are some of the wildlife you may come upon. Even the skunks don’t usually present too much of a danger, but they can be pests.  Just don’t keep food lying around and tie your food in bags from strings or rope from tree branches. 
Snakes – rattle snakes are rare but can be dangerous .There are more rattle snake sightings upriver from Business 80 along the American River Parkway. Stinging nettles are native to Sacramento area and if you touch them with your skin it will burn immensely for awhile.  Poison oak – Don’t burn by mistake because the smoke can cause serious reactions. Mosquitoes – Minimize exposure of your skin during late afternoon and evening hours by wearing long sleeves.



Fires – It’s best not to have campfires, especially along the parkway.  An alternative is to purchase a propane heater and/or camp stove for keeping warm and for cooking.  If you sleep in a tent, a simple candle in an open jar will provide heat for the small space inside a tent and the jar will help prevent lit candles from falling over and causing fires.  If you have no alternative and must have a fire to keep warm, dig a small pit and make sure there are no tree roots exposed to the pit.  If you need a fire to cook, use a small fire using only several twigs at a time, instead of a log. There is too much danger of fires in the summer.  
Protection from predators – Use your valuables as a pillow, by sleeping with your backpack or purse under your head, or wrap a strap around your arms.  If you sleep in a hidden location, make sure that no stranger sees you enter or leave your camp.  
Avoid violent situations.
Healthy feet “Happy Feet” – Sweater sleeves can be cut off to make socks.  After you cut the sleeve off, use the cut part for your feet, folding the edges so they fit around your feet flat and comfortably.  You can also keep a plastic bag over your foot. Try to keep dry between toes. Use a petroleum base jelly on your feet to deal with soreness and dryness.
Restroom facilities – Finding facilities open to the public are often hard to find. More and more restaurants are not allowing people to use their restrooms without making a purchase. Public and government buildings such as libraries, post offices, county administration, city hall and others are good places to go. In some buildings you will have to ask security for access.  Homeless and other services agencies usually have restrooms. Restrooms at public parks are somewhat scarce and are usually closed from early evening to morning. If no restrooms are available, urinate on dirt or vegetation, never on impermeable surfaces.
Camp etiquette and types of locations to sleep – Sometimes you will see a bedroll and other belongings that appear to be abandoned.  Don’t assume they are abandoned.  The owner will probably come back for them that same night or even next week. Leave other people’s possessions alone.  That way you perpetuate the custom so that you may feel better about leaving your possessions somewhere when you have an appointment or other reason. Don’t assume your possessions will be there when you return, though, since not everyone follows that custom and sometimes the police or rangers take things (they are required to give a notice before they take your things and leave a notice where you can pick your things up, but they don’t always follow this procedure).
Dumpster Diving – It can be dangerous and it is illegal to go through residential garbage cans. Some businesses put useful items outside their dumpters. You can find many useful items in dumpsters and with a good stick with a hook on the end, you can safely scavenge without having to enter the dumpster. Behind laundramats may be good for blankets and clothing. If someone else is searching a dumpster, let them finish before you start. Be careful with food by checking expiration dates, freshness and ability to decontaminate (such as vegetables and fruits without cuts). 
Unfortunately if you are homeless in Sacramento, there is no guarantee of housing or shelter, and the existing shelters are often filled up. We list the resources below as a guide to trying to get help. Rapid rehousing should be your goal. When you go to a shelter, ask if there is anyone who can help you find permanent housing through a transitional housing program (see the next page). Though transitional housing programs have long wait lists, they can help you find a permanent place to live.
An emergency shelter is a facility whose purpose is to provide temporary or transitional shelter for the homeless in general or for specific populations of the homeless.

Most low-income households are eligible for government housing that will cost at least 30% of their income for rent,  but the waiting lists are very long.
Public Housing is housing owned and operated by the housing authority.  In Sacramento that is the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency.  There is a long waiting list for public housing in Sacramento.  Most of the time, the waiting list is closed.  Watch for announcements when the public housing waiting list is open.
Some of these projects advertise their availability and you can apply directly at the building or at a leasing office. Most of the time, the best way to get into this kind of housing is to go through special  programs offered by community agencies that will help you get into housing when you finish the program. 
The programs prioritize housing for people who:
• have a disability, including mental illness and/or HIV/AIDS • have a substance abuse problem and want to get treatment for it • have children under 18 with them • are over 60 years old  • are a veteran 
There is not very much Project Based housing available now, and there are waiting lists at most buildings. It may take you months or longer to get housing you need, but it is worth the try.  www.sacwaitlist.com

Your Rights: If you live in public housing and have a disagreement with your manager, including eviction, you can file a grievance to challenge what is happening.  Look on any notices you have for how to ask for a grievance and for how long you have to ask for a grievance.  You can also appeal if you are denied admission to public housing.  You can contact Legal Services of Northern California for help at (916) 551-2150.



Housing Choice (formerly called Section 8) vouchers are offered by the local government (the Housing Authority). They allow you to stay in any apartment or house where the landlord will accept them, and you pay a limited amount of money you can afford for rent (usually 30% of your income). Housing Choice voucher recipients are also protected by rent control and state laws. An owner also has to give you at least 90 days notice if they want to stop accepting section 8 vouchers.  If your unit is protected by rent control, the owner must also comply with those requirements. When you receive a Housing Choice voucher you will have 60 days to find a landlord who will accept it, or you will have to return the voucher. At this time not many landlords are accepting the vouchers. There is a long waiting list for housing choice vouchers in Sacramento.  Most of the time, the waiting list is closed.  Watch for announcements when the housing choice voucher waiting list is open.Housing Choice vouchers can be terminated by the housing authority if you do not comply with the many program requirements. If the housing authority gives you a notice that it is terminating your voucher, you can appeal. You can also appeal if you disagree with the amount of your voucher of if you are denied a voucher.  Look on any notices you have for how to ask for a grievance and for how long you have to ask for a grievance.  You can contact Legal Services of Northern California for help.

What If I’m Homeless And I’m In The Hospital?
It is illegal for the hospital to drop you off in the street after your treatment if you are homeless. The hospital discharge staff must work with you to find a safe place to go. Ask to speak to a social worker prior to your discharge.
Financial Help
Families: If you are homeless and receive or qualify for CalWORKs, you may be able to get Homeless Assistance Money,  to help you move (see page 50 CalWORKs). 
Singles: You can apply for General Assistance (GA). GA provides short-term financial assistance and limited services that will enable a recipient either to find employment or to obtain support from another source (see page 60).
Emergency Shelters
Your Rights As A Homeless Camper

Both City and County Ordinances make it a misdemeanor offense to camp on public property, including the American River Parkway.  Persons found camping in Sacramento can be given a citation, which requires appearance in court and/or payment of a fine. You have a right to a jury trial if the citation is a misdemeanor and a right to only a court trial if you are cited for an infraction.  If you are cited for a misdemeanor, you are entitled to be represented by a public defender.  It is unlikely, if you plead “not guilty” and request appointment of a public defender, that they will take your case to trial.
Before your camping and personal property may be removed, you are entitled to receive a “48 hour notice” which will tell you to remove your property or it will be confiscated and stored.  If it is not removed within 48 hours, it can be seized and stored, but a second notice must be given telling you where the property has been taken and how it can be reclaimed.
If your property is taken and stored without the required notice in County jurisdiction, you have a claim for violation of a settlement agreement.  If your property is taken and destroyed, you have the right to file a federal or state complaint for damages for seizure of property without due process.
Sacramento City Code 12.52.030 Unlawful camping – this ordinance, also, makes it against the law to camp on private property for longer than 24 hours, and to “store” camping equipment on public property (which could mean setting your camping gear on the ground).
Sacramento County Parks ordinance, 9.36.066.6 Prohibition of Carts in Park Facilities states that “Within the boundaries of the American River Parkway no person shall use a shopping cart, basket that is mounted on

2. Bad Conditions
If you have bad conditions in your unit, you should tell your landlord, in writing, to fix the problems. If your landlord does not fix the problems and you live in the County of  Sacramento, call Code Enforcement at (916) 874-6444.  In the City of Sacramento call (916) 264-5011 or 3-1-1.  
Under the City of Sacramento Rental Housing Inspection program, all rental units in the City of Sacramento must be inspected at least once every five years. You have the right to live in a place that has no holes in the wall, has working toilets, sinks, electricity, heat, no rats, roaches or other pests, and is clean. The landlord has to fix things that don’t work that you did not break. 
If you live in the City of Sacramento and you are told you must move by Code Enforcement (your unit is “red tagged”) you may be eligible for relocation assistance from the City which will be two times your monthly rent plus the amount of your prior security deposit.  (Sacramento City Code 8.100.920 et. seq.)
If your landlord will not fix problems, you should give written notice of the problem (remember to keep copies of everything relating to the problem), wait 30 days, and have proof of the problem. 
If you want to repair the problem yourself and deduct the cost from your rent, it must be a problem affecting your health or safety, not just something you want to change in the apartment.  Generally, the best approach is to pay full rent under protest and sue the landlord separately in small claims court.
3. Rent Control 
Rent control regulates the percentage by which a landlord can raise a tenants rent. It also requires that a tenant can only be evicted for good cause.  The City and County of Sacramento do not have rent control.  
If you have a month-to-month agreement, you can be evicted for no reason, but you must be given a 30-day written notice, or if you have lived in the unit for a year or more, you must be given a 60-day written notice. Your rent may be increased by any amount, with a 30-day written notice if you are a month-to-month tenant, but if it is raised more than 10% in a year you must be given a 60-day written notice. 
Contact the County Board of Supervisors at (916) 874-5411 to advocate for rent control as a protection for renters.  
4. Eviction Process
a. Written Notice - you must receive a notice in writing. Usually a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit, or a 30/60 day notice to vacate.  You can also get a 3-day notice to perform or quit for you to fix a violation of your lease or a 3-day notice to quit for waste, nuisance, illegal activity in the unit, or a lease violation you can’t fix.  If you live in public or subsidized housing, you cannot be evicted without good cause.
b. Summons and Complaint- This is the lawsuit. You have 5 days to answer it. If you are low income and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident you can call Legal Services of Northern California at (916) 551-2150 for a free answer or referral to other resources. You can also go to the Unlawful Detainer clinic at the Carol Miller Justice Center for help. 
c. Sheriff’s 5-day Notice to Vacate - If you don’t answer a summons and complaint or lose in court, you will get a 5-day notice to vacate. If you do not move out, you will be locked out by the sheriff sometime on or after the 5th day.
If you are being evicted, you can get help with your defense from Legal Services of Northern California. Call (916) 551-2150. They are located at 515 12th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814. They can help you prepare a written response for you for free or at low cost, depending on your income. The service is also available in Spanish. You can also get help answering an Unlawful Detainer Summons from the Unlawful Detainer clinic at the Carol Miller Justice Center.
5. Illegal Lockout
If your landlord locks you out without using the eviction process, immediately call the City of Sacramento Police or the Sacramento County Sheriff. When the police respond show them some proof that you are a tenant (receipts, ID, etc) and ask them to tell your landlord to let you back in. If the police officer does not respond, call the non-emergency phone number for Sherriff’s Department  at (916) 874-5115 or the Police Department at (916) 264-5471 and ask to speak to the watch commander.  If they won’t help, call Legal Service of Northern California at (916) 551-2150 for assistance.
6. 28-Day Shuffle
If you have lived in a residential hotel for over 30 days, you are a tenant and can only be evicted through a legal eviction. You should not be asked to move rooms or leave for a few days. If this happens, contact Legal Services of Northern California or the Human Rights/Fair Houisng Commission (below). If you are locked out, you should call the police and show them your receipts. If you leave voluntarily, for example, if you don’t have enough money for rent, it is not illegal.
7. Housing Discrimination
If you are discriminated against in trying to buy property, rent, or use services provided to other tenants because of your race, color, religion, sex (including sexual harassment), nationality, handicap, marital status, familial status (whether you have children), lawful source of income (for example that you get welfare) or sexual orientation, call:
Legal Services of Northern California    			(916) 551-2150

(916) 478-7230	| Toll-free: (800) 884-1684		FAX: (916) 478-7338 | TTY: (800) 700-2320
Sacramento Regional Human Rights/Fair Housing Commission	(916) 444-0178
Domestic Violence:  A tenant in public or subsidized housing cannot be evicted because the tenant is a victim of domestic violence.  Domestic violence victims in private housing should also be protected because evicting a domestic violence victim is sex discrimination.  Contact Legal Services of Northern California for assistance or DFEH or HUD to file a complaint.

CalFresh
CalFresh (formerly called Food Stamps) is a government program that provides benefits so that you and your family will not go hungry. If you are eligible, you get an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card that you can use to buy food at most stores. CalFresh is free but you must apply for them. 
Many people don’t know they qualify or do not know how to apply. If you need food, you should apply.  Everyone has the right to apply and deserves to have enough to eat. 
You can use your CalFresh card at (to find a retailer near you that welcomes SNAP EBT customers, visit http://www.snapretailerlocator.com):
•  Almost every food store
•  Many Farmer's Markets
•  Some meals-on-wheels programs
• Some shelters are authorized to take CalFresh as payment from clients
You can use it to purchase:
•  Any food item except hot foods that are meant to be eaten immediately
• Seeds to grow your own food. 
• CalFresh cannot be used for non-food products such as soap or diapers. 



Each month you get a dollar amount  deposited into your EBT card to help you buy food. The amount your household will  receive depends on your income and other factors. 
 


1. General Eligibility 
You must meet the program’s income limits. In order to see if you qualify, visit www.calfresh.ca.gov/PG841.htm and see “How Do I Apply for CalFresh” on page 12. You don’t have to have a home, or a place to cook, or a permanent address to get CalFresh. You can also own a home and/or car and still be eligible for CalFresh.  
Some persons do not qualify:
•    SSI/SSP recipients in California cannot get CalFresh because a food allowance is included in the SSI grant. 
•     Some non-citizens legally in the United States can get CalFresh (see page 58 Guide for Non-Citizens” ). Even if you are not eligible for this reason, other adults or children living in your home may be eligible and should apply. Your immigration status will not be affected if other family members use nutrition programs like CalFresh.
•    If you were convicted of a felony for sales or manufacturing of drugs after August 22, 1996, you will be permanently ineligible for CalFresh.  If your felony was for possession or use of drugs, you can get CalFresh if you show that you are in a drug recovery program, or have completed one OR are on a waiting list for one, or sign an affidavit that you are no longer using drugs.
•    You can be permanently disqualified from the program if you are caught selling CalFresh benefits worth over $500. 
•    Strikers and their families are usually kept out of the program, unless they meet the income limits before the strike.
2. Special Rules for Students 
Students between the ages of 18 and 49 who are enrolled at least half-time in a program of higher education can get CalFresh if they meet ANY of the following: 
•    	Enrolled in CalWORKs 
•    	Working and getting paid at least 20 hours per week, or an average of 80 hours per month 
•    	Receiving or eligible for a work-study grant 
• 	A full-time student with a child under 12 
•	A part-time student with a child under 6 or between the ages of 6 and 12 with no adequate childcare available   
•   	 In a government approved job training program
•	Not planning to register for the next normal school term 
If the student doesn’t meet any one of these requirements, the other people in the home may still get CalFresh even though the student can’t. 
3. “Households” 
The term “household” has special meaning in the CalFresh Program. It does not mean you have a house. A household can be one person who lives alone, or it can be a group of persons, related or unrelated, who live in the same place. There is no limit to the number of “households” that can be in the same home. A “household”  includes those who buy and prepare their own food together. 
Some relatives who live together must be included in the same household, even if they do NOT buy and prepare their meals together.  These are:
•    Your immediate family—you, your spouse, your children age 21 and under 
•    Your parents and you (unless you are over 21) 
•    Those who are acting as parents for a child under 18, unless the child is in foster care. 
Relatives who CAN be considered  separate households even if they live in the same place include:
•    Parents living with their adult children (over 21) 
•    Adult brothers and sisters.    
4. Income Limits 
Gross income limit:  You can have an income and get CalFresh if the household’s “gross income” or total income before taxes is below certain limits. If anyone in your household is disabled or over 60 years old, this limit does not apply to you and you should consider applying if you are having trouble purchasing food and are not receiving SSI/SSP.   
Income that doesn’t count includes:
•     Money earned by children under age 18 if they are in school at least half-time 
•    Money paid for you to a third party by someone who is not legally obligated to pay you, (for example if your grandparent pays your rent directly to the landlord)
•    Most loans
•    Federal payments to help you with utilities
•    “Earned Income Tax Credit” for one full year after you get it
•     CalWORKs homeless assistance 
•    Foster care payments (when the foster children are not part of the household) 
•    Agent Orange Settlement payments. 
•    Money you pay in court-ordered child support

1. Emergency CalFresh Benefits
You may be eligible to get CalFresh the same day or at most within 3 days if one of the following applies:
•     The cost of your rent/mortgage payment or utilities is more than your monthly income and cash-on-hand. 
•    Your liquid resources are less than the gross income requirements.
To apply for emergency CalFresh, you need to do the application and check the box that says you want expedited CalFresh. The worker will ask for your proof of identity, residence, income, and resources, but you cannot be denied for not having these documents with you. 
There are many ways to prove your identity, including your driver’s license, a sworn statement, a phone call to someone who knows you, a library card, or a letter addressed to you. 
If your case is approved, an EBT card and PIN number will be issued no later than the third calendar day after you apply so you can access your food stamp benefits. If the third day falls on a weekend or holiday, you have the right to receive your CalFresh on that Friday. If you apply after the 15th you will get the CalFresh for that month and your next month’s CalFresh. 
2. Non Emergency 
Application: You have the right to apply in your own language and to turn in a written application on the day you go in. If someone tells you to come back to submit the application, you may insist on filing an application that same day.  
It is best to fill out the application form as completely as you can, but you only need to fill out your name, address and signature to file an application. Once you turn in your application, you will be given an interview with an eligibility worker.
You can call (916) 874-2072 to have an application mailed to you; fill it out and send it in by mail, or have someone else turn it in for you. You will still have to be interviewed either by phone or in the office depending on your situation. Phone interviews can be scheduled to make it easier for you to finish the application.  
You can also apply online at www.mybenefitscalwin.org.
Interview:  You may bring someone along to help you. You may be asked to sign a form making them your “authorized representative,” but you do not have to. You will go over the application you filled out and will be asked for additional information. 
You should be given a list of documents that you will need to complete the application process. You may be given ten days to turn in the documents. If you do not have all the necessary documents, you or someone you know may sign a statement explaining why not. 
You may be able to receive benefits while you continue to gather the required information. The eligibility worker should help you get some of your missing papers.
If everyone in your household is disabled or over 60 years of age you may request either that an eligibility worker be sent to your home at a time you agree to or that you be interviewed by phone. A worker may also visit or phone you if no adult in your household can go to the office for good reasons such as illness or disability. 
Next steps:  If you are asked to mail additional papers to the County office, ask the worker for a stamped envelope addressed to him or her. If you take in papers, get a receipt. 
Keep your own copy of all the paperwork. If you need help and your worker is not available, the worker of the day or a supervisor should help you.  
Within 30 days of applying, the County office must either mail you an EBT card and PIN number and a notice of approval or inform you in writing that you do not qualify and the reason why not. 
If you are denied CalFresh, and believe you are eligible, request a hearing or call a legal aid organization right away. (see page 70 “Good Advice.”)



1. Quarterly Reports 
As of August 2013, you only have to report every six months. The form is called SAR-7. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!  You will be asked to report your income, property and household composition, and any changes in your income, property or household composition that you anticipate in the next three months. You will need to fill it out in order to continue to be eligible. Under certain circumstances, you must report changes before your required reporting month.
If your SAR-7 gets lost, or you do not turn it in, your case will be suspended at the end of the month. If you had a good reason, such as being sick or not receiving the form in the mail, your worker may grant you “good cause” and your benefits may be restored.  You have up to 30 days after your report due date to turn in your report to have your benefits reinstated regardless of whether or not you had a “good cause” for not turning in your report on time.   
2. Recertification
You must be reviewed for benefits each year before the end of your certification period or your CalFresh will be cut off. You will receive a letter that tells you the application for this review is due. Be sure to complete this on time so you can continue to receive CalFresh without a break. 
3. Work Registration 
All CalFresh household members age 16 through age 59 who do not have children in the home must be screened for work registration.  This may or may not be required, and is contingent upon state unemployment levels. 
If you are not found to be exempt, you must agree to: 
•     Respond to a request of additional information regarding employment status or availability for employment 
•    Report to a suitable job if referred 
•     Accept a suitable job offer
•     Not voluntarily reduce work hours to less than 30 hours per week 
•    Cooperate with the requirements of any welfare-to-work program you are assigned to, including CalFresh "workfare"
In CalFresh workfare, the number of hours you do is based on the amount of your CalFresh benefits divided by minimum wage. Sometimes when unemployment is high the County may not require workfare.
Fair Hearing 
Everyone has the right to a “fair hearing” if you feel you were unfairly denied or to correct any mistakes (see pg 67.) If you appeal within 10 days or up to the day the action takes effect (whichever period of time is longer), your usual benefits will continue until the matter is resolved.























1. Food Pantries and Free Meals
Food pantries are places that give food to people in need. Most food pantries are volunteer private organizations that can make their own rules about who can be served. Most of them are limited to serving people in certain areas and for one to four times a month. They may require some kind of identification and proof that you are low income. Generally, food pantries never have as much as is needed. Foods distributed most often include canned foods, rice, beans, bread, cereal, and occasionally produce items.
Free hot meals are offered at many private volunteer agencies and churches. The frequency of the meals varies from daily in some places to once a month.
Here are some food or referral agencies:

WIC





The Women, Infants and Children program, called WIC, provides vouchers for certain foods and nutrition education for pregnant women, women who just had a baby, breastfeeding women , and children up to age 5 (including foster children and children raised by their father as well as other children).
You qualify for WIC if your household receives Food Stamps, CalWORKs or full Medi-Cal. Or you qualify if your “gross income” (your income before taxes and deductions) is below a certain level. See “How Do I Apply for WIC?”  on this page for more information. 
If you are pregnant, bring verification when you apply. Also, you or your child must be medically identified as in need of better nutrition. It is helpful, but not requi ¿ red, to bring current medical information when you apply. 
If you are treated unfairly in any way, you can complain to the supervisor at the WIC site or hand in a short note or letter requesting a hearing. Include the date, your name and address and an explaination of  your complaint. Keep a copy of your letter. 



•     Special checks to buy healthy foods such as milk, juice, eggs, cheese, cereal, dry beans and peas, and peanut butter.
•     Cash vouchers to purchase fruits and vegetables.
•     WIC also provides a limited number of vouchers that can be used at Farmer’s Markets for fruits and vegetables. 
• 	Information about nutrition and health to help you and your family eat well and be healthy 
•     Support and information about breastfeeding your baby
•     Vouchers for forumla (if you are not breastfeeding exclusively) and cereals for infants are available.
•     Help in finding health care and other community services
•     Extra vouchers: Women who breastfeed exclusively receive an extra set of vouchers providing them with additional foods including tuna and fresh carrots.  
•     Counseling: WIC participants are regularly scheduled to attend meetings and individual counseling. Some of the topics discussed include car seat safety, tooth decay, food and nutrition, and breastfeeding. 
You can share your concerns about breastfeeding and children’s eating habits with a counselor and other mothers involved in the program. In some WIC programs, breastfeeding women can come into the WIC clinic any time they have a question, a problem, or need support.

How Do I Apply for WIC?    






What Are The Benefits?   
Child Nutrition 
Can My Child Get Free School Breakfast and Lunch?     
All low-income children qualify for free or reduced price school meals, regardless of immigration status. Children who eat regular meals learn better and are usually sick less than other children. All public schools and some private and parochial schools offer breakfast and lunch programs. 
Your child qualifies for free or reduced-price meals if your gross family income per month (income before taxes or deductions) is below a certain level. 
You should be given an application for the meal program in your own language at the beginning of the school year or whenever your child transfers. You can also ask for one at any time from the school office, because if your income goes down during the year, your child may become eligible.
If you receive CalWORKs, food stamps, or the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, the only information you have to give is your case number, and your child automatically qualifies for free meals. 
If you do not receive CalWORKs or food stamps, you will have to list the total income of your household, the names of household members, and the Social Security number of the adult signing the application. If you do not have a number, just write “none”. You are not required to apply for a number or give a reason for not having one. 
In some cases, you must give the school some proof of your income (by showing your pay stubs to the school secretary, for example). All information gathered is confidential and cannot be given to other government agencies. 
If the information you give on the application shows that you qualify, your child can begin receiving free or reduced-price meals immediately. 
Foster children are often eligible for free meals, regardless of the foster parents’ income.

At many schools, pregnant and breastfeeding students can get extra food at breakfast or lunch, or an extra snack. To be eligible, the student must provide some written verification that she is pregnant or breastfeeding from a doctor, nurse, midwife, clinic, WIC or Cal-Learn program. 



All children age 18 and under regardless of income can eat free, nutritious meals during the summer or any time when school is out for more than 15 days through the Summer Meals Program. If the child is physically disabled, the age limit is 21. No application or other kind of paperwork is required.  Meals and snacks are served at schools, parks, community centers and recreation centers. 
To find out where your children can eat free when they are not in school, call the City of Sacarmento at (916) 498-1000 or the CA Department of Education for summer meal sites: 800-952-5609. If you want to learn how to start free Summer Lunch in your area, call the California Food Policy Advocates at (213) 482-8200. For more information, visit http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/nu/sf/.



•   The law says that children who get free or reduced-price meals cannot be treated differently than those who get full-price meals. No separate lines, different meals or meal tickets, required work, or other types of discrimination are allowed. 
•     Ask the school, child-care sponsor, or summer recreation program sponsor for a “fair hearing” if you apply and are unfairly denied. Also request the hearing if you receive notice that your benefits will be cut. By doing so within 10 days, your child’s benefits will continue until the hearing takes place.

Healthcare
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law. The goal of health reform is make sure that more Americans have insurance, either public or private. Medi-Cal, a state-subsidized healthcare, will expand to cover higher incomes.  More information about Medi-Cal, eligibility and the application process is below. 
Starting in January 2014, if you do not qualify for Medi-Cal or another public health care program, you will be required to have another means of health insurance. Even if you do not qualify for Medi-Cal, you may be eligible for the Premium Assistance Program. This can help to reduce the cost of your health insurance premium, which is the amount of money you pay to buy health insurance coverage each month. Depending on your income, Cost Sharing Assistance can reduce the amount of health care expenses an individual has to pay when getting care. These expenses include copayments and other health care bills. 
Covered California’s Health Benefit Exchange marketplace can help you find affordable health plans and answer any questions you may have. Visit www.coveredca.com or call 888-975-1142. To calculate an estimatead cost of healthcare, visit www.coveredca.com/calculating_the_cost.html. You may also contact Sacramento Covered at 1-866-850-4321 for assistance in finding a health plan. 
Starting January 1, 2014, you cannot be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition (this has already begun for children under age 19). If you are a young adult under age 26, you can remain on your parents’ private health coverage. (See www.health.lsnc.net/healthreform.) For more information on changes to private health insurance, visit www.coveredca.com. 



Medi-Cal is a health insurance program to help pay the medical expenses of low income families, seniors, and people with disabilities.
The state and federal government fund Medi-Cal. There are many Medi-Cal programs with different rules. Depending on which program you qualify for and how much money you make, Medi-Cal may pay for all your medical expenses or you might have to pay a share of the cost when you access health care services in a particular month. 
1. Groups of Eligibility
You can get Medi-Cal if you:
• Meet  income and resource tests and • Are a California resident and intend to stay in California   	  and •Fit within one of the eligible groups.
The major groups who can get Medi-Cal are: 
• People getting SSI, CalWORKs, foster care, adoption assistance, or certain immigrants receiving Entrant or Refugee Cash Assistance benefits. These groups get free Medi-Cal with no “Share of Cost.” • Pregnant women • Children under age 21 • Adults 65 or over • People of any age who are disabled or blind by SSI guidelines (whether or not you are getting SSI)  • Families in which at least one parent is absent, deceased, disabled or unable to work, unemployed, or under-employed. “Unemployed” means that the parent who has earned the most in the past two years is working less than 100 hours a month. “Underemployed” means that the family’s earned income is below the federal poverty level.  • Taking care of a related child under 21 • Refugees • People living in a long term care facility • People recieving dialysis for kidney failure • People infected with tuberculosis (unless undocumented) • Women (and some men) diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer. 
Besides fitting into one of the above categories, you must also meet certain income and resource limits. If your children are low income but get too much income to qualify for Medi-Cal, en
2. Immigration Status 
If you are a California resident and meet other Medi-Cal requirements, you can apply for a restricted Medi-Cal card, even if you’re undocumented. This will pay for emergency services, pregnancy-related care and long term care services. 
Most low income legal immigrants can get regular (also called full-scope) Medi-Cal to cover most of their medically necessary health needs. 
Many immigrants can get full health coverage, even if they do not have a green card, for example those who are victims of domestic violence, or those in the process of adjusting their legal status (i.e., they are applying for Legal Permanent Residency).
If you are receiving CalWORKs, SSI, foster care, or certain refugee benefits, you get Medi-Cal automatically and do not need to apply separately. 



1. Get an Application Form 
You can get one mailed to you by calling the DHA toll-free number at 1 (888) 747-1222; or you can get one at a DHA Office. (See page 69); or you can get one at many hospitals and clinics, whether they are private or county-run. 
2. Children Under Age 19 
 You may apply for Medi-Cal for your children. Children who receive a CHDP visit are screened for temporary eligibility for Medi-Cal. If a child is eligible, he/she is pre-enrolled in temporary, full-scope  Medi-Cal at no cost for up to 60 days (for the month of the visit and the month after). 
Infants who were born to a woman recieving Medi-Cal at the time of birth should receive Medi-Cal ongoing until the age of one. 
3. Filling Out the Application
You can get help filling out the application by calling (916) 874-3100.  A Medi-Cal worker will go over the application you filled out. If you are asked for more information, you will be given a list of what is needed and a specific date by which the information must be mailed to the Medi-Cal office. A "return appointment" is not necessary. 
 4. Provide Needed Papers
• Identification with your name and current address on it. For example, a birth certificate, driver’s license, or California ID card.  If you lack ID, you can fill out a form called “PA 853” and swear that you are who you say you are , or documents to verify income or disability status may also serve as proof of identity. 
• Social Security Number or Card (or proof of application for the card) only for those requesting "full-scope" benefits. 
• Proof of income (like check stubs,a copy of your tax return, a self-affidavit or statement of income if you are paid in cash or do not have any other way to prove income)
• Proof that you live in Sacramento County (a document that has your name and an address on it, such as an ID, a bill mailed to your house, school attendance records, pay stubs, etc.) for each adult on the application. 
• Proof of U.S. citizenship and identity or acceptable immigration status for each person on the application who has declared acceptable immigration status.   If you are a parent applying for children only, you do not need to submit proof of your immigration status.
• Vehicle registration if ownership of more than one vehicle is declared. 
• Verification of child or dependent care, educational expenses and/or health insurance premiums or court ordered child support payments can be used as deductions, but are not needed to determine eligibility.  
5. Cooperate With Child Support Services 
If one parent is absent, most people will have to cooperate with DHA and a county agency called the Department of Child Support Services (DCSS.) You must provide information you have about the other parent such as an address or social security number, to establish who your child’s absent father or mother is and whether that parent can provide the child with medical insurance. 
6. Wait for Approval
Normally, the Medi-Cal office will approve or deny your application within 45 days of receiving it, except for the faster ways for children, described above. If the state must evaluate a disability, the approval or denial can be delayed up to 90 days. If Medi-Cal denies your benefits, you can appeal. See pg. 67 for the “Hearings and Complaints” section.
7. The Medi-Cal Card
Once you have been “approved,” you may ask your worker for a written verification of your eligibility status from the Medi-Cal Eligibility Data Systems (MEDS) or your medical provider may be able to use your Social Security Number to verify your eligibility status through their Point of Service system.
Your permanent white plastic Medi-Cal card, called a “Benefit Identification Card” or BIC, is mailed to your address. Each person listed on your application will get one, even if they aren’t eligible for Medi-Cal, because if the family must pay a monthly Share of Cost, the medical expenses of every person listed on the application can be used to meet the Share of Cost. If you don’t get your plastic card by the end of the month, or lose it, contact your worker. Keep the BIC even if your Medi-Cal stops. If you need Medi-Cal again, you can use the same BIC.
8. Authorization For Service Under Fee-for-Service
Before certain medical services can be performed for you the state or your health plan has to give an authorization for the service. This is called a Treatment Authorization Request (TAR). 
This does NOT apply to emergency care, office visits, and most drugs. It is the job of the doctor, pharmacist, or other service provider, not the patient, to get this authorization from the state. 
However, if the state or health plan denies or changes the authorization, the state will notify you and your doctor. You can appeal any unreasonable delay, denial, reduction, or termination of care. (See pg. 67” "Hearings and Complaints") 
9. If You Are Pregnant 
If you are not more than 30 weeks pregnant and have too much income to be eligible for free Medi-Cal, you may be eligible for a program called AIM (Access for Infants and Mothers). Call AIM at (800) 433-2611. You can also get AIM even if you have medical insurance, if your insurance does not cover pregnancy or if you have a $500 "deductible".
Many pregnant woman can get a temporary Medi-Cal card called "Presumptive Eligibility" immediately, without showing proof of pregnancy or providing information on property, car, or resources.  This will help you get early prenatal care, lab tests and medication. You still have to turn in a regular Medi-Cal application and provide proof of income by the end of the next month if you still need Medi-Cal.
As soon as the baby is born call your worker to report the name and date to add the new baby to your family case record. The baby needs his or her own card by the end of the month after birth. However, you should not have to fill out a new Medi-Cal application for your baby.  If you have trouble reaching your worker to tell the worker about the birth of your baby, some WIC offices and clinics have “Newborn Referral Forms” you can mail to DHA.  Or you can get one yourself on the internet at 
http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/formsandpubs/forms/Forms/mc330.pdf.
10. If You Are Disabled 
If you have certain severe physical or mental problems, (such as mental retardation or inability to walk) or if you have AIDS, you may also be able to get Medi-Cal based on disability even before the state determines you are disabled. This is called "Presumptive Disability". Bring medical reports that show you are disabled when you apply. Both children and adults can get disability Medi-Cal.   The Medi-Cal Program for Aged and Disabled Persons provides  Medi-Cal services at no Share of Cost if you are not able to work and are 65 years of age or older or disabled. Information about the Working Disabled program is on page 25.
11. Women (and Men) with Breast or Cervical Cancer
If you are under 65 without health insurance, or underinsured (you have high premiums, deductibles, co-payments or Share of Cost) and you have been both screened and diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer, you may get free Medi-Cal immediately and during the entire time you are receiving cancer  treatment, depending on your income.  There are no resource limits for this program.
If you do not qualify for the above program because of age or immigration status, you may still get time limited Medi-Cal for cancer-related services only under a more limited “state only” program.  Under that program, breast cancer treatment for men or women is limited to 18 months (which includes males who have been screened and diagnosed with breast cancer),  and cervical cancer treatment is limited to 24 months.  
12. Retroactive Benefits
If you had medical or pharmacy services from a Medi-Cal provider in the 3 months before you applied for Medi-Cal, ask your worker for a form to apply for “retroactive benefits.” The mail-in application also asks if you want this. If you were eligible for Medi-Cal during those 3 months, Medi-Cal may pay those bills. If you’ve already paid the bills and Medi-Cal covers the services, your clinic, doctor, dentist, or pharmacist should provide the refund to you.  If you have trouble getting a refund, call Legal Services at (916) 551-2150.


 Your countable income determines whether or not you can get Medi-Cal for free or whether you have to pay a “Share of Cost.” (You only pay a "share of cost" in months when you actually use services.)  Certain types of income don’t count or can be subtracted. The different Medi-Cal programs count the income limits differently. It’s important when applying for Medi-Cal to report income and expenses including:
• Up to $175 (this may be subject to change) for child care for each child age 2 and over 
• $200 (this may be subject to change) for childcare for each child under age two 
• Court-ordered child and spousal support paid 
• Child support received
• Educational expenses 
• Business expenses of self-employed parents. 
Once a family qualifies for Medi-Cal, hundreds of dollars of their earnings might not count against their eligibility.
Elderly (65 and older), blind or disabled persons can	 deduct (these amounts may be subject to change):
• $20 
• $65 from earned income 
• Half of any remaining earned income 
• Any health insurance premiums paid by you. 
Some elderly or disabled people, even though not receiving SSI, may get free Medi-Cal if the countable monthly income is less than a certain amount. This is called the “Aged and Disabled Federal Poverty Level”  Medi-Cal program. If you are over these limits you can still get Medi-Cal, but there will be a share of cost.
Special Low-Cost Medi-Cal for Working Disabled 	Persons: 
If you are a disabled working person or are married and both of you are working and disabled, you can get lower cost Medi-Cal if your income if you meet the income requirements. If you qualify, you will have to pay a monthly premium that goes up the more income that you have. Income deductions and exemptions apply, so apply even if you think your income may be too high; you can contact Legal Services of Northern California at (916) 551-2150 if you are denied. 



The resource limit does not apply to pregnant women for care related to their pregnancy, or to children under 19 in certain Medi-Cal programs. For anyone else, your family’s resources must be below certain limits to get Medi-Cal: 	
Some assets do not count. The home you live in, furnishings, personal items, and some non-term life insurance policies don’t count. Other real estate may not count if you are not the only owner or are not able to sell it.  For some Medi-Cal programs one car does not count, and for some programs a car is not counted if its value is under a specific amount.



1. Who Pays Share of Cost
Some people must pay, or agree to pay, a “Share of Cost” for each month that they have a medical expense. Medi-Cal will then pay the rest of the bill for covered services that month. You do NOT have to pay a Share of Cost if: 
• You are in one of the groups that receive free Medi-Cal (such as those getting CalWORKs, SSI, foster care, adoption assistance, 1931(b) Medi-Cal, or the aged and disabled programs).
• Your countable income is below certain income limits.
If you have Medi-Cal with a Share of Cost, you begin each month with your Share of Cost limit. You don’t have to pay anything in months that you have no medical expense. You can use past medical bills and the medical bills of family members listed on your application to meet your Share of Cost, including unpaid bills that they are trying to collect from you. You cannot count the same billed item or service twice, but you can carry the balance of an unpaid bill over to later months if a bill is for more than your Share of Cost. If your income goes down, notify your worker so your “Share of Cost” will go down.
2. Share of Cost: Children 
Children whose income is too high for free Medi-Cal can get Medi-Cal with a Share of Cost (see the Childrens’ Health Care section on page 28). You can find the premiums at 1-800 880-5305. Even if a child’s parents start making more money and the parents have to start immediately paying a Share of Cost as a result, the child still receives Medi-Cal for free until their "Annual Redetermination." 



1. Once a Year Eligibility Form
Individuals receiving Medi-Cal must have their eligibility rechecked (or “redetermined”) every 12 months. You get a "redetermination packet" in the mail which you must fill out and send back.  You do not have to send in copies of documents with your redetermination form. 
2. Mid-Year Status Report For Adults
Some adults recieving Medi-Cal must fill out the Mid-Year Status Report (MSR) in order to keep Medi-Cal.  Some groups of people do not have to fill our the MSR:  a child under 21; the parent or guardian of a CalWORKS child; pregnant women who have reported their pregnancy to the county, people who are disabled or over 65, or someone in the  Breast or Cervical Cancer Program. The report should come about 5 months after you start getting Medi-Cal and must be returned to the Medi-Cal office by the date on the form.
3. Reporting Changes for Adults 
Adults must report to DHA any significant changes that may affect your eligibility within 10 days after the change. You must quickly report to your worker if you move, begin making more money (or less money), someone moves in or out of your house or you are pregnant. Even if you report a change that hurts your eligibility, you have important rights before the DHA cuts your Medi-Cal.
4. Losing Welfare Does Not Mean That You Lose Medi-Cal 
Leaving the CalWORKs program (for example because of a sanction, time-limit, or failure to comply with WTW rules) does not mean that you lose free Medi-Cal. If you lose your Medi-Cal after you leave welfare, contact Legal Services at (916) 551-2150 for help and advice. 
5. Transitional Medi-Cal 
You might be eligible for up to 1 year of free (no Share of Cost) Medi-Cal (called transitional Medi-Cal or TMC) if you received CalWORKs or what is called "Section 1931(b) Medi-Cal" during at least 3 of the last 6 months, and you lost CalWORKs or Section 1931(b) Medi-Cal because you started making too much money. 
During the first six months of TMC, you and your family qualify for free Medi-Cal no matter how much income you have. 
After that, you remain eligible for TMC if you received TMC for the entire six months; you are still living in California;you remain employed; you have a child under 18 in the home; and you meet the income qualifications. 
Eligible families can receive TMC for up to one year. There is no lifetime limit on TMC. If your income goes down you can qualify again for regular Medi-Cal.   If it then goes up again you can return to TMC with new time limits. 
There are no “resource” or property limits for TMC. TMC requires quarterly reports like a QR-7 for cash aid, but on a different form.	
6. Four Month Continuing  Medi-Cal 
If you lose CalWORKs or Section 1931(b) because you start getting more child or spousal support, a family can get free Continuing Medi-Cal, regardless of your income, but just for 4 months. It is important that you turn in an SAR-7 or any other change reporting form explaining why you are leaving CalWORKs or Section 1931(b), to help make sure you get Transitional or Continuing Medi-Cal. The children’s free Medi-Cal continues until their next scheduled annual redetermination.
7. Former Foster Children
If you were in Foster Care on or after your 18th birthday and you were "emancipated," you are automatically eligible for free Medi-Cal until you turn 21 even if your income goes up. Chldren leaving foster care before their 18th birthday are not eligible for this program. 
8. If You Get A Notice That Medi-Cal Will Be Cut Off
DHA must send you a written notice of action at least 10 days before it cuts off, denies, delays or reduces your Medi-Cal benefits. The notice explains the reason for their action and your right to ask for a fair hearing. (See pg. 67 Hearings and Complaints).
When a change occurs affecting your Medi-Cal eligibility, DHA must determine whether you are eligible for any other type of Medi-Cal, before sending you a notice of action cutting off your benefits. They have to look in your available records, including CalWORKs, CalFresh and other records for any missing necessary information. DHA can send you a form that only asks for the information it needs; it cannot ask for information it already has or does not need to determine whether you are still eligible for Medi-Cal. 
DHA must give you at least 30 days to complete the form. If you do not send in a completed form, DHA will send you a written notice of action that you will lose your Medi-Cal benefits. If your form is incomplete, DHA must first try to contact you by telephone and writing to get missing information before it cuts your benefits. If you send in your form within 30 days of being cut from Medi-Cal, and that information shows you were still eligible, DHA must restore Medi-Cal benefits without making you reapply.
9. If You Move
You must report a move to the Medi-Cal worker right away. You should have no break in service if you move within California. If you move to a new county, report to DHA and also to the welfare office in the new county, and the counties will manage the transferring of your case. 
10. If You Were Billed Twice
The doctor or health service provider cannot bill both you and Medi-Cal for the same care. If you think your doctor has billed you unfairly, you should contact Legal Services. 
11. Lost or Stolen Cards 
Notify your Medi-worker and a replacement card will be sent to you. If there is a medical emergency, you may receive a written notice of eligibility at your welfare office. 




There are two ways to receive your medical care under Medi-Cal in Sacramento County:
”Fee for service” (regular Medi-Cal), or Geographic Managed Care (GMC) which gives services through private health plans.   Medi-Cal participants except for people on SSI and people in long term care must use GMC.
1.  Fee for Service (Regular Medi-Cal)
In Fee for Service Medi-Cal you can use any doctor, clinic, hospital, pharmacy or other provider willing to accept Medi-Cal. You must tell the doctor or clinic that you have Medi-Cal before you get care. If you don’t, the provider can legally bill you for all services that you get. 
2. Geographic Managed Care
In Sacramento County, everyone except people in nursing homes or people who ask for and are given special permission must use “geographic managed care” (GMC) for their physical health issues.
When you join a GMC plan, you must see the doctors, pharmacists and hospitals that are part of your plan. You must select a GMC plan.  Unless you have an emergency, you must get approval for all care from your GMC  provider.  The GMC will receive money each month for your health care even if you don’t get services. The GMC is responsible for providing or making arrangements for you to get all Medi-Cal covered services. 
3.Dental Care
Due to severe budget cuts by the state, only children, pregnant women, and persons in long term care can get Medi-Cal coverage for dental services. See page 31 for Dental Clinics.
4. How to Choose a GMC Plan
When you first enroll in Medi-Cal you will get a packet in the mail. The packet will contain a form for you to choose a GMC Plan.  You will be able to choose one of five GMC Plans: Kaiser, HealthNet, Molina and  Blue Cross.
 Fill it out the “choice form” and return it.  It’s a good idea to send the form by certified mail. If you don’t complete the form and return it within 30 days, the state will choose a GMC Plan for you.  
5. Hearings, Grievances, and Leaving a GMC Plan 
If your HMO denies services or you are not satisfied with the services, you have many options. You can file a grievance with your GMC Plan.  Your HMO must tell you how to file a grievance. The GMC Plan must resolve your grievance within 30 days, or less if you have an emergency. If you are still not satisfied complain in writing to the Department of Managed Health Care HMO Help Center, IMR Unit, 980 Ninth Street, Suite 500, Sacramento, CA 95814-2725. Their phone number is   (888) HMO-2219, TDD (877) 688-9891. You can also go to their website at  www.hmohelp.ca.gov.
You have the right to ask for a fair hearing to dispute anything the GMC Plan does. (see page 67, "Hearings and Complaints.") While waiting for a state hearing, the GMC Plan must continue to provide medical services to you.
6. Mental Health Managed Care
Mental Health services for Medi-Cal recipients are also provided through a managed care system operated through “Local Mental Health Plans” in each county.  For further discussion of these services (see page 32 “Mental Health Services.”)



If you are between 12 and 21 years old and a citizen or legal resident, you can apply for “Minor Consent  Services” to get free and confidential medical treatment without parental consent related to:
• Drug or alcohol abuse treatment or counseling (except methadone treatment) 
• Sexually transmitted diseases 
• Pregnancy and abortion 
• Family planning 
• Outpatient mental health (not overnight in a hospital) 
• Sexual abuse
Your parents won’t be required to give information about their income or resources or pay toward the medical services, unless you want Medi-Cal for services other than those listed above. 
DHA won’t tell your parents or send Medi-Cal mailings to your home without your permission. These services can be used by minors even if they already have Medi-Cal or any other health program.  
To apply, fill out the regular Medi-Cal application and another short form for Minor Consent Services at DHA or with a DHA Eligibility Worker at the site where you are receiving care. You will have to fill out a new short form each month you need treatment, except for mental health services. For that, you need a letter from a mental health professional explaining that you meet certain conditions for getting mental health services and how long you will need treatment. You will still have to complete the short form each month to update your eligibility.
If you already get Medi-Cal through your parents’ case, you may already have a plastic Medi-Cal card. But don’t use the plastic card for Minor Consent services. You will be sent a temporary card to use instead.

Childrens’ Health Care
Targeted Low Income Children’s Program
1. Am I Eligible? 
The Healthy Families Program has been eliminated and replaced with the Targeted Low-Income Children’s Program (TLICP). To be eligible, the applicants must be uninsured California  resident children ages 0 to 19 who have had no other health insurance. Families must meet certain income requirements.

The child must be without employer-based or private health insurance for at least three months before the application, with some exceptions. The child can obtain three months of retroactive  Medi-Cal prior to becoming eligible for TLICP, or can be on “Share of Cost” Medi-Cal. Eighteen-year-olds can apply on their own. The child stays eligible for 12 months continuously once it is decided that he or she is  eligible, even if the income changes. The cost of the items you own (“resources”) does not count against you. 
2. Residency Requirements 
You must sign a statement that each person who is applying for TLICP intends to stay in California with no plans to leave. Children who are U.S. citizens will be asked to provide a copy of their birth certificate. Immigrant children can be eligible if they are “qualified” immigrants (see page 65 “Guide for Non Citizens.”)
3. What Does It Cost? 
Depending on your income, you could pay monthly premiums ranging from $0 to $13 per child (no more than $39 per month). One child=$13/month, two children=$26/month, three children=$39/month (these amounts are subject to change). If you fall in the higher income group, you will receive a report in the middle of the year to see if your income has dropped, which would mean you would pay less. 

Any time your income drops or increases you should report it to the local county the within 10 days  at  to see if you can pay less.  Also, if you pay three months of premiums in 
advance, you will get a fourth month of coverage for free. If you pay 9 months in advance, you get 12 months of coverage.  Except for the first month, you can pay your premiums at some Western Union Convenience Pay locations.

4. What Are The Income Limits?

Your children qualify for TLICP if your monthly		income is too high for Medi Cal but below other specific limits.  
5. What Are the Benefits?
The program offers health, dental,  mental health, and vision services. 

6. How Do I Apply?
You may get an application form at any DHA Office, at many health clinics or call (916) 875-8600. If your child is found to be ineligible for TLICP at the annual redetermination (e.g. because your family income goes down) your child should be given temporary full-scope Medi-Cal while the information is sent to the county (with your permission) to determine if your child is eligible for regular no-cost Medi-Cal. This is called the “Presumptive Eligibility Program.”  You should not be required to apply separately for Medi-Cal or to provide any information again, unless the county needs more information from you to determine eligibility.





CHDP provides free early and regular health exams for many 
low-income children up to 19 years of age; Medi-Cal eligible children up to 21 years of age; and Head Start and State preschool children. There are no immigration requirements, however, visits are allowed based on a “periodicity schedule”, with some exceptions for physical exams needed for school, for children in foster care and for problems that might occur between screenings. 

Children in Medi-Cal Managed Care can get more screenings than the state’s schedule allows. CHDP offers physical exams, immunizations, vision and hearing testing, lead poisoning testing, nutritional check, teeth and gum check, and some lab tests including sickle cell. For more information call (800) 993-2437. 

The “CHDP Gateway To Health Insurance” program allows children who go to a CHDP provider for a health exam or well child check-up to pre-enroll in full, no-cost Medi-Cal temporarily if they agree to complete a simple confidential (electronic) application at the provider’s office. If your child qualifies for no-cost Medi-Cal after completing the simple application, your child will receive no-cost Medi-Cal temporarily, beginning on the first day of the month that the simple application is submitted and ending the last day of the following month.

Also, if you request it on the application, Medi-Cal for Families mail-in application will be sent to you automatically. If you apply for Medi-Cal for your child during the Medi-Cal pre-enrollment period, the no cost Medi-Cal coverage will continue until a final Medi-Cal determination is made.  

Infants under one year of age who are born to a mother who was recieving Medi-Cal at the time of birth are eligible for “Deemed Eligibility” to have full-scope Medi-Cal until their first birthday without filling out the additional Medi-Cal application. Be sure to include the mother's name and Medi-Cal number on the CHDP Gateway application.





Children’s Medical Services (or California Children’s Services) case manages and provides health services for children up to age 21 with eligible major medical conditions caused by accidents, diseases, and congenital disabilities, whether or not the children also have Medi-Cal. Undocumented children may qualify. For eligibility information, call 			(800)-288-4584. Service providers are all over the county.

Family income must meet income requirements, or may be greater than the requirements if their CCS-related medical expenses are expected to be more than 20% of the family's income. Children enrolled in Healthy Families are eligible regardless of income, but must be referred and screened for acceptance.  

There is no family income limit for children who need services to confirm a CCS-eligible medical condition; or were adopted with a known CCS-eligible medical condition; or are applying only for services through the Medical Therapy Program; or are Medi-Cal beneficiaries, full scope, no share of cost; or are TLICP subscribers.

Can I Get Insurance If I’m Low    Income But Can’t Get Medi-Cal?
Children’s Medical Services
The County provides free or low-cost health services to people who can show proof that they live in Sacramento County, including low-income people who are not eligible for Medi-Cal or who have medical expenses that Medi-Cal, Medicare, and private insurance will not fully cover. This program is called the County Medically Indigent Services Program (CMISP). You may apply at the Primary Care Center at 4600 Broadway or call (916) 874-9670. 

The Low-Income Health Program (LIHP) is a health care program designed to transition CMISP applicants to Medi-Cal in January 2014. Qualified individuals provide health care coverage to uninsured adults 19-64 without children. CMISP applicants will automatically be screened for LIHP, so there is no need to fill out a separate application. If you qualify for LIHP, Molina Healthcare will send you information on your primare care medical home. 

Molina Healthcare’s Free Neighborhood Shuttle provides transportation to medical clinics, shopping centers and the Department of Human Assistance. For more information, call (877) 665-4623.

Clinic Services: All recipients of General Assistance (GA) are automatically eligible for CMISP Clinic Services for one year. 

Other persons who need to apply for CMISP may do so at the time they request medical services at the following clinics: 

Primary Care Center 
4600 Broadway 
Sacramento, CA (916) 874-9670 
 
Dental Services: Emergency dental services are provided by the Dental Clinic. GA recipients are automatically eligible for CMISP dental services. All other applicants may apply for CMISP dental services at the time they request dental services at the following clinic or at (916) 874-8300: 

For Triage & Walk-Ins: 4600 Broadway Suite 1400, Sacramento                 

For AppointmentsOnly: 4600 Broadway, Suite 2100, 	Sacramento 

Emergencies: Ask the hospital receptionist if the services you are seeking may be provided through a contract between the hospital and the Sacramento County Medically Indigent Services Program (CMISP). 

If you are seen in an emergency room that contracts for out-patient services under the CMIS Program, you have the right to request an eligibility determination. The hospital will give you a referral form instructing you how to apply for CMISP. A CMISP medical consultant will review the reason for your emergency room visit. Only treatment of conditions, which would lead to disability or death if not immediately treated, will be approved for payment. 

Information: The following 24 hour telephone information numbers are available: 
 
Clinic Information Line: 
(916) 874-8912 

Dental Information Line: 
(916) 874-8300

The following rules must be met to qualify for CMISP:

Residency: Must verify you have established residency in Sacramento County by physical presence and intent to remain.

Resources: All available resources must be utilized. A CMISP applicant must apply for all financial resources that may be available.  There are resource limits. 

Resources that count include cash, checking or savings accounts, bonds, certificates of deposit (CD) and other forms of negotiable securities. One vehicle used for transportation is exempt. Life Insurance may be exempt if it does not exceed a certain level. 

These resources don’t count: essential household equipment, furniture and personal and tools, supplies and equipment needed for rehabilitation maintenance and self-support. 
Property used as the home is exempt. Other real property is limited to a net value and must meet the income producing rule.

Maintenance Need Limits

When your income is more than the limit, you will be required to pay or agree to pay the amount over the limit toward your medical expenses before the CMISP will pay. 

For assistance in determining your eligibility for CMISP, call the Department of Human Assistance at (916) 874-9238.

Sacramento County says you must have a medical need to apply for CMISP. If you have a problem applying and need services, say that you want a “medical override.”

Mental Health and

Mental Health Services
Developmental Services
In Home Care and Long Term Care
In Home Supportive Services


In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) serves aged, blind, or disabled persons who are unable to perform activities of daily living and cannot remain safely in their own homes without help. Through IHSS, qualified recipients may receive assistance with daily tasks, such as: 
• bathing 
• dressing 
• cooking 
• cleaning 
• grooming 
• feeding

To be eligible for IHSS services, a person must receive SSI or meet income and resource guidelines. In addition, the individual must be either: 
• 65 years or older 
• blind 
• permanently disabled, or 
• a disabled child requiring extraordinary care

Anyone who recognizes that a person is in need of in-home assistance may refer a client to IHSS. Once a referral is received, a social worker assigned to the case conducts an assessment to determine the applicant’s need. The determination will take into consideration the applicant’s medical condition, living arrangement, and resources that may already be available. 

Once eligibility has been established, IHSS can assist a client with locating a caregiver. A friend or relative may serve as a caregiver, or a referral may be selected through the IHSS Registry. Once a caregiver is selected, the client acts as the employer and is responsible for supervision and signing time sheets. IHSS will arrange for payment. 

Working together, IHSS and the caregiver ensure that each client is able to remain in familiar surroundings – safely, comfortably and with as much independence as possible. Contact the Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services, Senior and Adult Services at (916) 874-9471 for more information. Insist on filing an application if they say you are not eligible.






If you are caring for someone that a doctor has recommended for 24-hour care by skilled nurses for a long period of time, you may contact the State Central Registry to obtain referrals to long term care facilities. 

(800) 777-7575

http://www.calregistry.com/

There is a difference between board and care facilities and nursing facilities. Medi-Cal will pay for long term care in a nursing facility but not in a board and care home. Before you send someone to any kind of long term care facility, you should visit the places and inspect them thoroughly. If you are not happy with the referrals you can call again for more.

Medicare

Medicare is a federal health insurance program. There are three parts to the program: “Part A” (hospital insurance), “Part B” (medical insurance), and “Part D “ (prescription drug insurance). The general information number is 
(800) 633 4227. The premiums in this section are for accurate for 2013. 

1. Part A : Hospital Insurance

You are automatically eligible for Medicare Part A free of charge if you are one of the following:
•     You are 65 or older and are eligible for Social Security retiree benefits based on your own or your spouse’s employment 
•     You are a federal employee who retired after 1982 and have enough quarters of coverage 
•    You have been receiving Social Security Disability Income payments for 24 consecutive months
•     You are age 50 or older and are a disabled widow or widower who has received Social Security through your spouse for at least 2 years 
•     You have end-stage kidney disease, or you have Lou Gehrig's disease (in either case, you still must have worked enough quarters, however, even though you don’t need to be 65) 

People who are not automatically eligible for Medicare Part A may enroll voluntarily if you meet all of the following three requirements: 
•     You are 65 or older and 
•     You are a U.S. citizen, or a legal alien who has resided in the U.S. continuously for at least five years and
•     You purchase both Parts A and B of Medicare, or you purchase Part B only. You may not purchase Part A only. 
If you meet these three requirements for voluntary Part A, your monthly premium depends on your work history.  
2. Part B : Medical Insurance
If you meet the eligibility guidelines for Part A, you will be eligible for Part B. The premium is higher for those with higher incomes .
If you have a low income and low resources, the state may pay for your Medicare premiums under Medi-Cal or the Medicare Savings Program.

Medicare does not cover all types of health care needs, nor is it free of cost. It does NOT cover custodial care in a nursing home or at home, dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing aids. For the services that are covered by Medicare, you have to pay co-payments.
3.	Part A Coverage
Medicare will pay for hospital care if a doctor has decided that you need inpatient care and the hospital participates in Medicare. You will pay a hospital deductible for the first 60 days in a hospital. If you remain in the hospital for days 61 to 90, you pay $296 per day and Medicare pays the balance. If you need hospital care after the 90th day you pay $592 each day and Medicare pays the balance, for up to 60 extra days. These amounts may be subject to change.
4. Skilled Nursing and Hospice  Services
 After a three day prior hospitalization, Medicare pays for daily (five to seven days per week) skilled nursing and therapy services in a Medicare certified skilled nursing facility for persons who are terminall ill.  Medicare pays for the first 20 days in full and days 21-100 on a copayment basis. 
Medicare pays for skilled nursing and therapy services in the home if you are homebound and meet other requirements.  There are no copayments for home health services. 5.  Part B Coverage
Part B pays 80% of “allowable” charges for a variety of outpatient care,medical equipment, and ambulance services. You pay the remaining 20%, an annual deductible and a 20% excess charge if the provider does not take " Medicare assignment."   Ask your provider if he or she will accept assignment.

6.	Part D Coverage
Part D pays for outpatient drug coverage.  To obtain Part D coverage, you must enroll into a Medicare Part D drug plan. Not all Part D plans are the same.  Each plan has its own drug formulary, cost sharing requirements and restrictions on coverage. If you have questions, call Legal Services at (916) 551-2150.   
7. Medicare Advantage HMOs
A Medicare Advantage HMO is a health plan that enrolls people who have both Medicare Parts A and B. Generally, persons who have end stage renal disease (kidney failure) cannot enroll into a Medicare HMO. If you join a Medicare HMO, you must use the HMO for all of your medical care, except for urgent care when you are out of the HMO’s service area.  
8. Other Information 
•     Many people receive both Medicare and Medi-Cal.  People who have both programs do not usually have to pay Medicare’s monthly premiums, deductibles, or co-payments. If you have both, only see health care providers that take Medicare and Medi-Cal. Show your insurance cards before you receive services. 
• Always carry your Medicare card with you
• Contact the Social Security office immediately if you lose your card or don’t get one
• Appeal any incorrect or unfair decision about your Medicare benefits
• For help with Medicare: (800) 434-0222.

Many organizations in Sacramento County offer help in job training. Beware of private employment agencies that charge you fees for finding a job. Many give low quality   training at high tuition, and encourage you to pay the tuition with expensive student loans that can ruin your credit. Use free or low cost services instead.
1.  One-Stop Career Centers
One-Stop Career Centers are located at different places across the city and county and provide computers, faxes, copiers, and job listings to help you look for work. The law requires that they also provide you with career counseling, money for transportation and childcare, as well as possibly paying for quality job training that leads to a job. Call Legal Aid (see "Good Advice", pg. 70) if you have any troubles getting these services. 
Sacramento County: The Sacramento Employment & Training Agency operates the One-Stop Career Centers. To find the one nearest you:

One Stop Career Centers are listed below. Services are available in various languages and they can help homeless people (you may have to bring an ID or use a shelter as an address if homeless.) Most will require you to attend an orientation class. The ones marked with an [*] participate in the CA New Start Program,  an employment readiness program for state parolees.

1. Filing For Unemployment
When you are unemployed, or working less than full time, and are ready, willing, and able to work, you may be eligible to receive unemployment insurance (UI) benefits.  You can apply on line at: 
https://eapply4ui.edd.ca.gov
(800) 300-5616 
Before you can get paid unemployment benefits, you must: 
• Have received enough wages during the base period to establish a claim.
• Be totally or partially unemployed through no fault of your own (laid off, not fired for “misconduct” or having not quit without a good reason).
• Be physically able to work and actively looking for work.
• If you are attending an approved training course you are not required to look for work, be available for work or accept work while in training).
The minimum weekly benefit amount is $40 and the maximum weekly benefit amount is $450. The normal maximum benefit period is 26 weeks.  You can request extensions of benefits up to a total of 99 weeks.
After you apply, you must complete a Continued Claim Certification form, DE 4581 and mail it to EDD every two weeks. If you qualify you begin recieving payments.
Attached to the check is a form for the next two weeks. If the state thinks you did not meet eligibility requirements, they will schedule a telephone interview. Then they can reduce or deny the check. If you disagree you may ask for a hearing. Also the past employer sometimes has a right to disagree with whether you are eligible and to ask for a hearing to oppose you getting a check. 
At the hearing, an impartial administrative law judge will listen to the evidence and decide whether you should get a check. About half of the people who go to a hearing win in the hearing.
2. Appeal Your  Denial 
Just because you are fired, even for a good reason, does not mean that you should not get UI benefits. If EDD says that you are not eligible for UI benefits, you can appeal it. To show that your  actions were not misconduct, you can argue that you made a mistake,  simply could not do the job, or that the action was an isolated occurrence. Also if you can show you had a good reason to quit a job you can get benefits.  Call Legal Services for help at (916) 551-2150.
If you appeal, keep filing your forms with EDD every week!
Besides unemployment benefits, the EDD (State Employment Development Department) offers the following: 
California Training Benefits (CTB) allows qualified persons to receive unemployment benefits while in approved training. 
Trade Adjustment Assistance Benefits if workers and their industry demonstrate damage because of imports and trade agreements.
Paid Family Leave for a worker to get up to six weeks of benefits for workers to take time off to be with a newborn or care for to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, or registered domestic partner.




If you have a problem at work and are a member of a union, contact your union representative. He or she can advise you about dealing with your employer or about contacting the correct government office. 
Wage Claims: You can file a wage claim with the Labor Commissioner for any amount (or in Small Claims Court for up to $7,500) if your employer does any of the following:
•   Pays less than the current minimum wage. There are exceptions, including minors.
•   Does not pay overtime. Overtime means time-and-a-half if you work more than 40 hours in a week OR more than 8 hours a day OR on the 7th day in a row. Overtime means double-time if you work more than 12 hours in a day OR more than 8 hours, the 7th day of a work in a row.
•   Takes improper deductions from your pay.
•   Does not give you your last paycheck immediately upon discharge or within 72 hours if you quit and don’t give 3 days notice.
•   After you lose your job, does not pay  vacation time you were promised and have earned.
•   Does not pay wages owed or pays you with a check that bounces.
•   Does not give you at least 10 minutes rest break for every 4 hours work and/or a meal break of at least a half hour, which can be unpaid, if you work at least a 5 hour shift. You can get penalty money if you don’t get the breaks.
The law also gives you waiting time penalties. These penalties can be up to 30 days’ pay for each day after termination you have to wait to receive all wages owed to you. Wages include regular pay, overtime, vacation pay, and penalties for not getting rest or meal breaks.  
To reach the Labor Commissioner’s office, contact the State Industrial Relations Department, Labor Standards Enforcement, 2031 Howe Ave, Suite 100, Sacramento, 95825 	(916) 620-6330. 
The Federal Department of Labor has an office that also helps people with similar problems. Its services are more limited. However, you can file an anonymous complaint with them to avoid retaliation by your employer. 
Contact the Department of Labor Sacramento office at 800 Capitol Mall, Sacramento or (916) 654-8178. This number and address is for the Department of Veterans’ Employment and Training within the Department of Labor.
It is illegal to discriminate against workers because of their race, sex, religion, national origin, citizenship, age, disability, political affiliation, or sexual orientation. It is also illegal to require sexual favors from an employee (sexual harassment). If you believe you have been discriminated against, you can file a complaint at the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in person or by mail to the San Francisco office, 350 The Embarcadero Suite 500, San Francisco, 94105. You may also reach the EEOC at (800) 669-4000. Visit http://www.eeoc.gov/employees/charge.cfm for more information. 
They will investigate your complaint and may be able to help solve your problem. If your case requires court action, you will be given a letter authorizing you to file a lawsuit. 
You can also call the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing Department (DFEH)			(800) 884-1684 for discrimination and sexual harassment claims.  DFEH accepts complaints for the same reasons as the EEOC.  DFEH also accepts discrimination complaints based on sexual orientation, whether you have children, marital status and your source of income (for example whether you get welfare).
Employers are required to provide safe, healthy work areas. If you are asked to work under unsafe or unhealthy conditions, a state agency will investigate your complaint, and your employer may be fined for violating the law. Contact the California Occupational Health and Safety Administration (Cal/OSHA) office nearest your work. The offices are listed in the State Government section in the front of the phone book white pages or at  www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/DistrictOffices.htm. 




1. State Disability Insurance 
If you cannot work for a temporary period because of an illness or injury that is not work related, or pregnancy, you may be able to get state disability insurance benefits (SDI). These benefits can last up to one year (39 weeks for employers and self-employed people who elected SDI coverage).
You must be unable to do your regular or customary normal work for at least eight consecutive days. You must have lost wages because of your disability or, if unemployed, have been actively looking for work. You must be under the care and treatment of a doctor during the first eight days of your disability, and to continue receiving benefits. 
You must complete and mail a “Claim Statement of Employee” within 49 days of the date you became disabled. If your disability prevents you from completing the claim form, or you are filing for benefits on behalf of a disabled or dead claimant, call (800) 480-3287 for required forms and help. 
Your must also ask if your doctor needs to complete and sign the “Doctor’s Certificate”. If your doctor will mail your completed claim to SDI, provide give him/her with an envelope addressed to the SDI office listed below. Mail your claim no earlier than 9 days,but no later than 49 days after the first day you became disabled. Mail the completed, signed “Claim Statement of Employee” together with the completed, signed “Doctor’s Certificate” to: 
State Disability Insurance, P.O. Box 201006, Stockton, CA 95201-9006.  You can request a claim form online at
http://www.edd.ca.gov/disability/Disability_Request_a_Claim_Form.htm or call	 (800) 480-3287.
You may not be eligible for SDI benefits if you: 
•    Are claiming or receiving asking for or getting Unemployment Insurance.
•   Are receiving workers’ compensation benefits at a weekly rate equal to or greater than the amount of SDI you would get.
•   Are in jail, prison, or recovery home because you were convicted of a crime.
•   Don’t have an independent medical examination when asked to do so.

You have the right to appeal any denial, disqualification, overpayment, or penalty. Specific instructions Information on how to appeal will be provided on the state forms you receive. If you file an appeal and you remain disabled, you must continue to complete and return continued claim certifications. 
For residents in a state-approved alcoholic recovery home or drug-free residential facility, the maximum payable period is 90 days. However, you can get SDI if your disability is related to or caused by acute or chronic alcoholism or drug abuse which you are being medically treated for. 
When your claim is received, the SDI office will notify you of your weekly benefit amount and ask for any additional information needed to determine your eligibility. If you meet all requirements, a check will be mailed to you from a central payment center. If you are eligible for further benefits, either additional payments will be sent automatically or a continued claim certification form for the next two weeks will be sent with the check. You must report income you receive, even though sometimes it does not reduce your SDI check. 
Coordination with Workers’ Compensation
If you also have a Workers’ Compensation claim and the insurance carrier delays or refuses payments, SDI may pay you benefits while your case is pending. However, SDI will pay benefits only for the period you are disabled and will file a lien to recover benefits paid. 
SDI and Workers’ Compensation are two separate programs. You cannot legally be paid full benefits from both programs for the same period. 
However, if your Workers’ Compensation benefit rate is less than your SDI rate, SDI may pay you the difference between the two rates.
Long-term or Permanent Disability: If you expect your disability to be long-term or permanent, lasting for more than one year, apply for SSDI and/or SSI from Social Security well before your year of SDI is over (see page 57 for Social Security Programs).
2. Workers’ Compensation 
If you are disabled because of a work injury or as a result of unhealthy, unsafe, or stressful conditions at work, you should apply for Workers’ Compensation. Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system, meaning that injured employees need not prove the injury was someone else’s fault. There are six basic types of workers’ compensation benefits: 
a. Medical Benefits: The employer pays for the medical care resulting from the work-related injury. 
b. Temporary Disability Benefits: These are paid every two weeks if you are unable to return to work within three days or are hospitalized overnight. The benefits are intended to partially replace two-thirds of the wages lost as a result of the injury, up to a maximum of $840 per week (this may be subject to change). For most injuries, payment will not last more than 104 weeks. 
c. Permanent Total Disability: If you have a permanent total disability you receive disability benefits each week for life. 
d.  Permanent Partial Disability:  The “percentage of disability” is based on a medical evaluation.  You receive weekly benefits for a period that increases with the percentage of disability, from 4 weeks for a 1% permanent disability up to 694 weeks for a 99% disability. Those with a permanent partial disability of 70% or more also receive a small life pension following the final payment of permanent partial disability benefits.
e.  Vocational rehabilitation services: These services are for when you are unable to return to your former type of work after the job injury. You are entitled to these services if they can reasonably be expected to return you to suitable gainful employment. The amount you receive will be less than Temporary Disability Benefits.
f.  Death benefits: If a worker is fatally injured, the employer pays burial expenses up to $5,000 and support payments for dependents. This amount may be subject to change. 
Filing a Workers’ Compensation claim:  If you need help filing a claim or if your employer does not have this insurance, contact: 	
(916) 928-3101 or (800) 736-7401. 
For problems with worker comp claims:
160 Promenade Circle, Suite 300				Sacramento, 95834
Disability Evaluation Unit	            (916) 928-3150
Information & Assistance Unit 	 (916) 928-3158
Retraining and Return to Work Unit  (510) 286-6990
Injured worker workshop: Held the first Tuesday of every month at 10:30 a.m.
You may also want to hire a private attorney to help you with your claim. Many lawyers will handle this type of case even if you cannot afford to pay in advance because their fees for Workers’ Compensation cases are set by law and are paid by the insurance company. If you are permanently disabled and do not expect to return to work, you may also qualify for Social Security or SSI.

Tax Credits
 
1. Earned Income Credit (EIC)
“The Earned Income Credit” (EIC) is a check that low-income working people can get from the government by filing a federal income tax return or filling out a W-5 form during the year, even if your income is so low that you do not owe federal taxes. You need a valid social security number to get this money.
Yearly income qualifications for earned income credit can be found at http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Preview-of-2012-EITC-Income-Limits,-Maximum-Credit--Amounts-and-Tax-Law-Updates. Note the higher income limits for married people.
If you are receiving CalWORKs, the Welfare Office cannot count this payment as part of your income if you spend the money in the month received or the month after. For the General Assistance program, this money does count as income.
You can also file for “retroactive” payments from the past three years. If you do not owe taxes, there is no penalty for filing for the credit late (after April 15th). 
You can claim EIC on the tax form (1040 or 1040A) or you can fill out just the first side of “Schedule EIC” instead and the IRS will figure it out for you. However, you may not use the 1040EZ form (the shortest form) to claim your EIC. 
For help getting the credit you can call the EIC hotline at         	(800) 601-5552. To get a 1040 or 1040A form for this year and past years, and to receive free tax assistance, call the IRS at  (800) 829-3676 and ask for VITA-Volunteer Income Tax Assistance. Forms are also available in libraries, post offices and other public places.
If you choose, you can receive this payment spread out during the year in lower payroll tax deductions instead of getting it all at once at the end of the year. To do this, ask your employer to fill out a W-5 form.
2. Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit
Families who pay for child or dependent care in order to work or look for work may be eligible for money or reduced taxes from both the federal and state governments. The dependent can be a child under the age of 13 or a dependent of any age who is unable to care for him or herself, including a disabled spouse. 
Parents will receive up to 35% of child care expenses, with certain limits. The amount you get is generally higher if your expenses are higher.
For both the federal and state credits, you must have a social security number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). You must have income from work and must provide the social security number of the child or dependent that is receiving care, and the name, address, taxpayer identification or social security number for the person or agency providing the care. 
The state credit is limited to families that meet income requirements. These can be found at https://www.ftb.ca.gov/individuals/faq/ivr/103.shtml. There is no income limit for the federal credit.
3. Renter's Tax Credit
The Renter’s Tax Credit is not a payment that you can receive, but a deduction that renters can make on their state income tax forms. Renters who owe no tax will get no benefit. You can access current Renter’s Tax Credit requirements at https://www.ftb.ca.gov/individuals/faq/ivr/203.shtml. 




CalWorks CalWorks
CalWORKs provides money for children under 19 years old and the relatives caring for them. Work and training are required of most adults. Most adults can only get CalWORKs cash aid for 24 months in a lifetime (as of 1/2013), although an individual assessment will determine how many months of aid you will receive). If you qualify for cash aid, you are also entitled to Medi-Cal for healthcare and CalFresh (food stamps). In Sacramento County, the CalWORKs agency is called DHA, the Department of Human Assistance.
Both one parent and two-parent families can get cash aid. In two-parent families, one of the parents must be disabled, or the parent that has earned the most money in the last two years must have worked less than 100 hours in the last four weeks before applying for cash aid. 
Children must live with a related adult and be 18 years old or under. Some 18 year olds can get cash aid until their 19th birthday if they will graduate by age 19 or have a disability that kept them from graduating.
If you are convicted of a drug-related felony after 1997, you cannot get any CalWORKs aid for yourself, but your children can still get cash aid.
For more information about CalWORKs, see the CalWORKs Fact Sheet on the DHA website: www.dha.saccounty.net.
2. Limits on Property and Resources
There are property limits (“resource limits”) for families, including specific limits for family members 60 years or older who are on aid. Visit http://www.dha.saccounty.net/benefits/Documents/CalWORKsFactSheet.pdf to access the current property limits.
• There is a limit on the value of a car you own if you apply for CalWORKs.  There are certain exceptions for cars, such as a car you live in, a car you need for a business, or a car used to transport a disabled person.
The maximum grant is cut dollar for dollar by any “unearned” income you have, such as social security survivor’s benefits, interest (like on a bank account), or unemployment money. Earned income, wages from work, or income based on a disability is not counted dollar for dollar, although the first $225 of disiblity or earned income will not count. Half of the remaining earned income after this amount will not count. (www.lsnc.net/fact_sheets/2013_CW_changes.pdf)
Families that have a disabled parent qualify for the higher “exempt” amount. See the CalWORKs Fact Sheet on the DHA website for more information: www.dha.saccounty.net.
3. Think About Time Limits Before You Take Cash Aid
You may not want to get cash aid if you have other income. Any month you get cash aid counts against the 24-month time limit, even if you are entitled only to a few dollars a month. You can get Medi-Cal, Food Stamps and child care money even when you do not get cash aid. Is the cash aid you will get worth “using up” a month of eligibility? Should you “save” the month in case you need it more at a later time in your life? Call Legal Services to discuss your options.
4. Maximum Family Grants (“MFG”)
You will not get more cash aid for children born while your family is getting CalWORKs. There are certain exceptions. Ask the worker or consult with a legal aid organization.



1. Income Limits
You can qualify for assistance if you meet certain income requirements. Once you begin to get assistance you can get more income, but there is still a limit. There is a special calculation if you have your own business or are self-employed. You should apply even if you are not sure that you qualify. For more information, please see the CalWORKs Fact Sheet on the DHA website: www.dha.saccounty.net.
 
Who Can Get CalWorks?
                 

1. Basic Benefits
•Medi-Cal to pay for health care (pg. 22: Medi-Cal)
• CalFresh (Food Stamps) in most cases (pg. 11: CalFresh) 
• Immediate Needs: an advance of up to $200 at the time you apply, or your whole check within 3 days if you have an eviction notice (Tell your worker when you first apply.)
• Homeless and Housing Assistance including eviction prevention, temporary shelter, move-in costs, rent subsidy, and help with cost of moving. With some exceptions, you can only get this once in your lifetime.
• Non-Recurring Special Needs: You can get up to $600 each time if you have to replace clothing or household items because of a fire, disaster, theft or other event beyond your control. You can also get this money for shelter if your home is so damaged or unlivable you can’t stay there. You must have less than $100 to get this money.
• Special Needs: You can get an extra $9 to $15 if you have special needs such as higher food costs because of a necessary special diet, or higher transportation or utility costs due to a medical condition.  Breast-feeding mothers can add $15 to their grant to help with their dietary needs. Tell your worker if you have these special needs.
• Welfare To Work Services such as counseling, job training, help finding work educational assistance, money for tools, uniforms, childcare, transportation, and housing relocation. 
• Money For Pregnant Women: After 6 months of pregnancy if you have no other children on CalWORKs, you may get an additional $47 until the baby is born. (Special rules apply)
• Child Support: You can get $50 extra each month if the other parent pays at least $50 of child support to the County’s Department of Child Support Services on time. The Department of Child Support Services should give you a list that shows when the other parent paid (an “accounting”).  
2. Diversion Payments
Instead of going on to cash aid you can apply for a large amount of money called a “diversion payment” to help you get or keep a job. Ask your worker for details. If they tell you Sacramento County does not offer diversion, call Legal Aid (see pg. 70). 
3. Immediate Need
You can get cash aid of $200 or your whole check in an emergency. You must have less than $100 and “immediate needs” when you apply or before you are approved. Be sure to tell the worker all of your needs, including money for diapers, medicine, transportation, laundry, or a utility shutoff notice.
4. Foster Care (Someone Else's Children)
If you are caring for someone else’s children, the children may qualify for Foster Care payments even if you are related to them. If a relative’s children live with you but do not get foster care, you should be able to get cash aid for them.
What Are The Benefits?
How Do I Apply for CalWorks?
You can apply for CalWORKs at the nearest DHA office (see page 68 - DHA Offices) or online at https://www.mybenefitscalwin.org. 
When you apply, you have a right to be treated with courtesy and without discrimination for any reason. The DHA workers must try to get you all the benefits for which you are eligible.  
Often, eligible people who urgently need the aid don’t get correct information, or don’t understand or get discouraged. If that is happening to you, be strong, insist on talking to a supervisor or the supervisor’s manager, seek out the help of someone who will advocate for you, or call a Legal Aid office. (See page 67 - Hearings and Complaints.)
1. Domestic Violence
If you are a victim of domestic violence, or suffering effects of past domestic violence tell the worker right away, because there are specially trained workers available to help you. Also, you may not need to do WTW or have other eligibility rules changed such as the Maximum Family Grant rule. 
2. Special Help for the Disabled 
If you have a physical or mental disability that makes it hard for you to go through the regular application process, DHA must give you special help. This might include: taking an application at your home, helping you fill out forms, reading all forms to you. Ask your worker for this help. If they won’t give it to you, contact the Civil Rights Liaison in the office or call Legal Services for help.  
3. Documents To Bring When You Apply
When applying for CalWORKs, bring the following documents with you. If you do not have some of them, go ahead and apply, and get a list of documents to be brought in later. Ask the worker to help you obtain missing documents. 
• Identification with your name and current address on it. This can be a birth certificate, driver’s license, California ID card
 • Social Security Numbers or Cards (or proof of application for the cards) 
 • Proof of income (like check stubs, a W2, or copy of your tax return)
 • Proof that you live in the county (a document that has your name and an address on it) for each person on the application 
 • If you do not have ID, you can also fill out a form to swear that you are who you say you are. DHA will use this temporarily until you get proof of identification
 • Proof of citizenship, alien or immigration status for each person on the application that has it 
 • Proof of your housing situation (rent receipts, lease agreement, etc.)
 • Auto payment papers and registration
 • Letters from a doctor if anyone in the household is pregnant, disabled, has a special medical need or needs a special diet
 • Any papers having to do with marriage, divorce, child support, or other circumstances that apply to your family.
4. Fingerprint Requirement
All adults (age 18 and over) and teen parents must be fingerprinted in order to apply for and get CalWORKs. If you refuse to be fingerprinted, your cash aid will be denied, or stopped if you're already getting it. If you are scheduled for fingerprinting on a day that will not work for you, ask to reschedule.
5. Next Steps
Keep in touch with your DHA eligibility worker and write down his or her name, phone number, and phone hours. If you are asked to mail additional papers to the welfare office, ask the worker for a stamped envelope addressed to him or her. 
If you take in papers, get a receipt. Keep your own copy of all the paperwork. If you need help and your worker is not available, the Worker of the Day should help you. 
Within 45 days of when you turn in your application, you must either receive your first payment, or a notice that you have been denied aid. If the DHA denies your aid, they must send you a letter explaining the reason. Do not sign a “withdrawal” of your application unless you understand and agree with the written reason you are given.
If you are approved for cash aid for yourself, you will be required to participate in WTW unless you qualify to be excused (also called "exemption" or "good cause"). You will be getting an appointment letter to WTW shortly after you are approved for cash aid.
6. EBT Card
DHA will give you an EBT “electronic benefits card” (Golden State ADVANTAGE) to use at banks, ATM machines and stores. You access your cash aid and food stamps ("CalFresh") through the EBT card. Ask your worker for a list of banks and ATMs near you that will not charge you a fee. Call (877) 328-9677 right away if the card is stolen, lost, or destroyed.  You can get back aid used after reporting the loss.




1. Report on a “SAR-7”
The Quarterly Report (QR-7) has been replaced with a Semi-Annual Report (SAR-7). Every six  months, you must  report changes in income, property or the number of people in your household. DHA will mail you a SAR-7 report form for you to do this.  The SAR-7 will also ask you to report any changes, including changes you expect in the next six months. 
2. Report All Your Income And Gifts
You should be careful to report all income you get or changes in your family. The welfare department will check bank, employer, and tax records to check your income, and accepts tips of suspected “welfare fraud” from the public.
3. Cooperate with Child Support Collection
Unless it could put you or your children in danger to do so, parents on cash aid must help (“cooperate with”) the Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) to collect child support from any absent parent. You must provide information you have about the other parent. You will get your CalWORKs grant plus an extra $50 per month for every month the other parent pays on time. 
If you do not cooperate and do not have a good reason (such as fear of the other parent), your grant will be reduced 25%.
4. Get Immunizations (“Shots”) For Your Children
When you apply for CalWORKs or at your annual redetermination, you must show proof that your children under age 6 have had their shots. 
5. Keep School-Age Children in School
If your child is under 16 and not attending school regularly without good cause, the adult’s cash aid will be cut off. If your child is over 16 and not attending school, or welfare to work activities, without good cause, only that child’s aid will be cut. In either case, the cash grant will be restored when you prove to DHA that the child is in school or has good cause. 


1. Weekly Participation Hours
The following rules apply to most families. As of January 2013, if you are a single parent with a child under 6, you have to work or participate in “welfare to work” activities 20 hours a week, unless you are excused.
If you are a single parent with no children under 6, the participation requirement is 30 hours a week unless someone is exempt. Two-parent families must work 35 hours, which may be shared by both parents, but one parent must do at least 20 hours or more per week.
If your child is under two years old, one adult per family may be excused from welfare to work activities (this can only occur once in the adult’s lifetime. 
If you are exempted for caring for a child between 12 and 23 months old or two children under 6 before January 2013, this exemption continued until you are called in to be “reengaged” in Welfare-to-Work as a mandatory participants (when reengaged, your 24 months of the full Welfare-to-Work activities will start; see below).
If you have used the one-time child under 2 exemption, you can still be exempt for caring for a child 3-12 months old. The length of time you are exempt will depend on your county’s policy. The time will count against your limit, though. (see www.lsnc.net/fact_sheets/2013_CW_changes.pdf)
If you need Mental Health, Substance Abuse or Domestic Violence Services, they can count towards your hours (or you can be excused or do fewer hours). 
DHA must give you an exemption from WTW, meaning you do not need to do WTW, if you are: 
• Caring for a first child under 12 months old, or any later child under 6 months old
• Pregnant, and DHA agrees with medical verification that the participation or work will harm your pregnancy
• Under 16 years old
• A full time volunteer in the Volunteers in Services to America (VISTA) program.
• You are a youth who is not pregnant or parenting and is 16 to 18 years old
• You are disabled for 30 days or more – can mean physically or mentally unable to particiapte for 20/30 hours per week for participation or work as verified by a doctor
• You are 60 years or age or older
Any months exempted for the following reasons do not count against your CalWORKs 48 month time clock;
If you do not qualify for an exemption, you may have good cause that excuses you from doing something WTW asks you to do. The 48-month time limit is not stopped by good cause (except see below on domestic violence). 
Good cause includes:
• Not getting supportive services you need (such as child care and transportation) to work or go to a WTW activity
• Child sick at home from school
• No transportation (for example your car broke down)
• You are homeless 
2. Domestic Violence Waiver:
DHA can waive some of the CalWORKs rules for victims of domestic violence, such as stop the 48 month time clock, not participate in WTW, stop child support collections, or waive the maximum family grant rule. The violence can be something that happened in the past or in the present.
3. Learning Disabilities
All WTW participants must be offered a learning disability (LD) screening. 
You can say you do not want the LD screening, but if you change your mind, you can ask for LD screening and evaluation anytime.  
If the evaluation shows you have a learning disability, your welfare-to-work plan must have activities that help you deal with your learning disability, such as tutoring or extra study time. DHA must decide whether job search will be useful for you, or if your time limits should be extended.


At present the services include:
Child care (see pg. 51)
Transportation Money: bus fare, parking costs, mileage payment, or funds to fix a car (if funding is available) 
Money for tools, books, fees, and uniforms if needed for work or training. DHA does not pay for tuition.
Mental Health Services: You should receive a mental health screening during orientation. Also, a DHA worker can suggest to you that you go to a mental health evaluation if they think you have a mental health barrier to finding or keeping a job. You can also ask for mental health evaluation anytime by calling your eligibility worker or WTW worker. 
Substance Abuse Services: You can ask for help with substance abuse treatment at anytime by calling your eligibility worker or WTW worker. If you find it hard to get or keep a job because of problems with alcohol or drugs, the DHA worker can refer you to a substance abuse clinical assessment. You may get help through a variety of rehabilitation services. You can continue getting these services as part of your WTW requirements while receiving cash aid.
You can go to a substance abuse treatment program as the WTW activity. You have the right to refuse any substance abuse treatment program as the WTW activity; however, if you do not go to a treatment program, you cannot use substance abuse as a reason to not work or not participate in WTW.


1. Orientation and Appraisal
Soon after you apply for cash aid, you will get an appointment letter to go to WTW orientation.  During the orientation, you will be told about WTW rules, time limits, and work requirements.
After Orientation, you will meet with your WTW worker in a one-on-one meeting called Appraisal. You will talk to your worker about your work and educational history, what kind of services you need (such as substance abuse, mental health, or if you are a victim of domestic violence), and anything else that will help you get the services you need in welfare-to-work. 
If you are already enrolled in an education or training that may qualify as a Self-Initiated Program, you need to tell your worker at Appraisal. This will let you do the education and training as your WTW activity instead of going through Job Club (see next column) and the rest of the WTW process.
2. Job Club
Unless you are already in school or working, Job Club will probably be your first WTW activity. Job Club is a four week activity. The WTW worker can shorten the job search requirement if they think it will not help you find a job.
You don’t have to do job search if:
• It would interfere with a full time job you already have
• You are enrolled in a Self-Initiated Program of college or vocational training
• You are in the Cal-LEARN program
• Doing a job search would not help you (example: you need basic English or literacy training first)
• You need other help with domestic violence, mental health, or substance abuse.
3. Assessment and WTW plan
If you don’t find a job in the first three weeks of job club, at the end of that week, you will have a “vocational assessment” to determine your next WTW activities. 
The worker will then come up with a WTW Plan based on your individual goals and needs. Don’t sign the WTW plan unless you understand and agree with it. Get a copy of it. The plan must be based on the assessment of your needs and skills. Ask for a hearing, a third party assessment, or call Legal Aid, if the plan is not what you want. 
4. Self Initated Programs
If on the date of your WTW appraisal you are already in school or training, or have enrolled to start school, your education or training can count as your WTW activity. This is called a SIP (“Self Initiated Program”) because you chose it yourself. It could be a college or vocational program. If you already have a 4-year college  degree, you cannot do a SIP unless it is for a teaching credential.
If you are a SIP, you will not have to follow the core/non-core activities requirement.  
DHA has a list of approved SIP programs.  If you are in a program that is on the approved list, DHA must approve it. If the program you are in is not on the approved list, DHA should approve it if it leads to employment. You need either a letter from a college counselor or letters from three people in your field of study stating that your program will lead to employment for DHA to approve it.
To continue in a SIP you must be making satisfactory progress toward a degree or certificate that leads to employment.
5. Help To Keep The Job—Post Employment Services 
Once you have found a job, the WTW program can help you with money for transportation, training,  tools, uniforms, and similar costs. WTW may be able to provide you limited help after you stop getting CAlWORKs because you found a job. You may be able to get two years of child care payments. You must ask for this money to get it. 
You may also continue to get Medi-Cal and CalFresh benefits after you leave CalWORKs, even if your income is too high.

Welfare-to-Work Program


In January 2013, a new Welfare-to-Work (WTW) 24-Month Time Clock was established within the CalWORKs 48-Month Time Limit. Your own time limit will be based on an assessment. The aid does not have to be used 24 months in a row. After the adult has been aided 24 months, their part of the grant is cut, but their children can still get aid. 
People already on CalWORKs before 1/1/2013 will have up to 24 months, or whatever time is left on their 48 month clock, to finish their educational activities in their welfare-to-work plan. If you finish your educational activities and have time left on your 48 months limit, you must do federal activities (generally work) in order to keep getting aid. (see www.lsnc.net/fact_sheets/2013_CW_changes.pdf) 
Certain months do not count against the 24 months of activities. They may count against the 48-month limit, though. These are 1.) if you are developing your work plan; 2.) have good cause for not participating; 3.) are on sanction; or 4.) you are meeting the federal rules for work participation (for single adult families, this means doing 20 hours of work or the first 12 months of vocational education). (see www.lsnc.net/fact_sheets/2013_CW_changes.pdf)
The 24-month limit can be extended if all adult parents or caretaker relatives in the home of the aided child meet any of these tests:
• 60 years or older
• Disabled, receiving State Disability  Insurance, Temporary Workers’ Compensation, In-Home Supportive Services or SSI, and unable to work or go to WTW
• Not able to go to WTW or employment because of an “impairment”, for example a learning disability or chronic mental illness. You must have a history of “full cooperation” in WTW for a sustained period.  Full cooperation means no sanctions and satisfactory attendance. 
However, even with a sanction this exemption can be granted if you were ever in WTW for 6 months straight, or if you were in WTW for two periods within a two year period that are equal to six or more months.
• There are no local jobs that accommodate your disabilities
• A non-parent relative taking care of a child “at risk of foster care placement” and that limits your ability to go to WTW or employment. Example, if you are a grandparent under age 60 who cannot both be regularly employed and care for the child, DHA can continue your CalWORKs aid rather than having the child enter foster care.
• A domestic abuse survivor who cannot do WTW because of the abuse. You do not have to be in a domestic abuse situation now. You will also qualify if you are suffering from the effects of past abuse and the effects limit your ability to go to WTW or work.
You only need to tell your worker (“self-declare”) about the domestic abuse; no other proof, not even a police report, is required unless the County has proof the information you gave was questionable. Your time will be extended for as long as you continue to suffer from the effects of the abuse or are in danger of more violence.
• Taking care of an ill or disabled household member if DHA agrees that this harms your ability to participate or work. 
Clock Stoppers or Exemptions
Apply for an exemption to “stop the clock” for any months which should not have been counted in your time limit. Your request should be in writing, but can be verbal.   
DHA has to send you a written decision within 15 days of the request (unless something happens that is beyond the DHA’s control). If you disagree with the decision you may request a state fair hearing.  DHA is required to look at your case records before asking you to provide information or documentation which you already turned in. 
Months that do not count toward your time limit include:
• Sanctioned or No Check—Any month you do not get a CalWORKs aid payment for yourself even if you receive various services like child-care or job training or counseling. No payment is issued for you if you are sanctioned that month, the payment would have been less than $10, or you are caring for an aided child but not aided yourself. 
• Disabled—Any month you are sick, disabled, or injured for over 30 days and it interferes with going to work or WTW. You may be required to provide a doctor’s report. This includes mental and physical illness. 
• Caring For a Sick Family Member—Any month you are caring for an ill or disabled person living in the home and that caretaking interfered with regular employment or participation in WTW activities.
• Foster Child Placement or Risk of Placement—Any month you are a non-parent relative taking care of a child who is a dependent ward of the court or “at risk of foster care placement” and that responsibility interfered with regular employment or participation in WTW activities. This can exempt, for example, a grandparent under age 60 who could not both be regularly employed and care for the child.
• Domestic Violence—Any month you cannot participate in CalWORKs as a result of domestic abuse. You do not have to be in a domestic abuse situation now. You also qualify if you are suffering from the effects of past abuse. You only need to tell your worker [“self-declare”] to qualify; no other proof, not even a police report, is required.
• Over 60— Any month the  parent or caretaker relative is 60 years or older.
• Child Support Repaid—All child support paid to the County by an absent parent takes time off your clock.  Ask the Department of Child Support Services to give you with an accounting of the amount of child support they have collected on your behalf during the 48-month period. Then ask your WTW worker or fill out and submit an exemption form to find out how many months of credit you get for the child support that was paid.
• Teen Parent—Any month you are a teen parent or pregnant, under age 19, do not yet have a GED or high school diploma, and either participate in or are excused from Cal Learn or another teen parent program approved by the DHA. You can be excused from Cal Learn in any month in which you can show the DHA you do not have necessary childcare or transportation, you are sick, disabled, or expelled and an alternative school program is not available. You can’t use Cal Learn as a clock-stopper after you get the GED or diploma. When there is no funding the Cal Learn program is not offered.
• Native American—You are a Native American who lives in “Indian Country”, or on a reservation if 50% or more of the adults there are unemployed.
In a family with two aided parents, both adults must meet one of the above clock stoppers for the month not to count. 


If you don’t follow the rules, you may have your assistance stopped. Your children’s assistance should continue.
In some cases both parents can have their cash aid cut. 
DHA can cut your part of the grant if they can show that you have:
• Failed or refused to participate in your assigned activity
• Failed to make good progress in your assigned activity
• Failed or refused to accept a job
• Failed or refused to keep a job
• Failed to keep the same amount of earnings
DHA must try to contact you and give you a chance to comply. If you fail to comply, DHA will send you a “Notice of Action” no sooner than 30 days before the cut in aid will take place. They will give you an appointment within 20 days to discuss the problem with your worker. 
It is very important for you to go to this meeting or call your worker to explain. You also have the right to ask for a fair hearing if you can’t work it out with your worker.
Your part of the grant will be cut until DHA agrees that you are complying with the rules.
Your cash aid cannot be cut if you have good cause for refusing to comply.
“Good cause” includes:  
• You are a victim of domestic violence 
• You were ill, or caring for a sick member of the family
• Your mental illness prevented you from doing what was asked of you
• You need child care for a child 12 years or younger and none is available
• Transportation is not available to your job or WTW activity
• There was discrimination at the job or training offered in terms of age, sex, race, religion, national origin, or physical 
or mental disability
• The job or job offer exceeded the daily or weekly hours of work customary for that job
• The round trip travel time to the job or activity is over two hours using public transportation, not counting time you need to take your children to school or child care
• You can only get to the activity by walking and you have to walk more than two miles round trip, not counting the distance needed to take children to school or child care
• The job or activity violates health and safety standards or does not provide worker’s compensation
• Accepting the job or work activity would interrupt an approved job or training program that you have in progress
• The job or community service would result in regular employees being fired, laid off, or having their hours or pay cut.
• Any other good reason that DHA agrees will temporarily prevent or significantly impair your ability to work or participate in WTW regularly.
During a sanction you continue to get childcare for the hours that you work. Your Medi-Cal must also continue.


If you are a teenager under 18 who is pregnant or who already has a child, has never been married, and you apply for CalWORKs, you must live with your own parent or parents, a guardian, another adult relative, or in an adult supervised arrangement in order to qualify.   
If you are a teen parent, or pregnant, and don’t have a high school diploma, GED or equivalent, and you receive CalWORKs cash aid, you have to be in a program called CAL-Learn. Cal-Learn provides you with supportive services in child care, transportation, and school supplies while you go to school.














If your family is homeless, or has received a notice to pay or quit, the DHA can give you money for temporary shelter and to help with move-in costs to a permanent home. 
The money is in addition to your CalWORKs cash aid and does not have to be paid back.
To apply you must be homeless or have received a notice to pay or quit: be eligible for CalWORKs and have less than $100. 
You may be asked to prove that you are homeless, but money cannot be denied or delayed if you do not have proof.
It is against the law for any government agency to take children away from parents for being homeless unless there is evidence of abuse or neglect. Homelessness by itself is not child abuse or neglect.
Usually you can get this homeless assistance aid only once in a lifetime. However, a family can get help more than once if the cause is:
• Domestic violence by a spouse, partner, or roommate
• A physical or mental illness (but not including drug addiction or alcoholism) and you have a written doctor’s note. 
• A fire or natural disaster or your home was condemned, or something beyond your control.
1. Temporary Shelter Money
You can get money for up to 16 days to stay in a hotel or shelter if they charge rent. You cannot use this money to pay to stay with a friend. You will get $65 to $125 per day to pay for shelter, depending on your family size. If you find some place for less money than they give you, you can keep the extra money. 
Show receipts to prove that you have paid something for shelter. (If you cannot show receipts, you can still get homeless aid money but it will be paid directly to the hotel or shelter). You will also have to fill out a form showing that you have looked for a permanent place to live for each day that you received the shelter.  
If eligible, DHA should help you the same day you apply, either by giving you a referral to a specific shelter with room for you or by giving you cash that day. If they refer you to a shelter, they must give you temporary shelter money by the next day.
Even if you decide not to go to the shelter ask for money for as many nights as needed during a single 16-day period. (For example, you cannot get a week now and another week two months from now.) If you needed but did not get all 16 days of temporary homeless assistance, ask for a hearing to collect it retroactively. After the 16 days are over, make sure to provide your worker with a mailing address (even if only temporary) within 10 days. 
2. Money for Permanent Housing
You can also get money to cover the actual cost of security deposits, “last month’s rent” deposit, and gas, electricity, and water deposits. The DHA will not pay for the first month’s rent, though, or old overdue utility bills because you must pay that from your CalWORKs cash aid.  
DHA will not pay unless you find a place where your share of the monthly rent is less than 80% of the monthly family income.
If you plan to share your housing, the landlord must agree to the rent-share plan. DHA will question the housing unless your name is on the lease. 
If you are a CalWORKs participant now you must be given this permanent housing assistance within one working day of showing that you have found a place. If you are not yet receiving CalWORKs benefits, you must first bring in the documents you need to prove you are eligible for CalWORKs, and proof that you have found a place (like a note from the landlord or a proposed rental agreement).
When you pay your landlord, get a receipt to give to your worker within 30 days. If you later move, the landlord and/or the utility companies should return the security deposits to you, not to the County, to use at your next residence. 
You can also get Permanent Housing Assistance to receive up to 2 months of back rent to prevent eviction. Each month of this back rent cannot be more than 80% of the family income. Call Legal Services for details (see pg 70). 
If you have questions, call 211.

Sacramento Food Bank and Family Services 	www.sacramentofoodbank.org Parent Education Hotline (916) 313-7622. SFBFS’ Parent Education program guides parents in raising children in a healthy supportive manner. After participating in workshops, families can earn baby supplies.
1. After School Enrichment
Especially if you are in CalWORKs, call your local elementary school to see if it has an after-school enrichment program. This program provides supervised after-school fun, growth, snacks, and learning for children from first through sixth grade. Children must be attending the school where the program is offered.
If your children attend school in the Sacramento City Unified School District, call (916) 643-9430 for information on enrollment in afterschool programs.  If your children attend school in a different school district, call the local district.
2. Homeless Children's Rights
Homeless children do not need a permanent address to enroll in school. They also:
• May remain at the same school they attended before becoming homeless, or enroll at the school serving the place they are living temporarily.
•  Cannot be denied enrollment just because any documents are not immediately available.
• Have the right to participate in school meals,and any other federal, state or local programs for which they are eligible.
• Must be provided transportation if other children get transportation.
• Cannot be isolated or separated from the main school environment just because they are homeless.
These special rights under federal McKinney-Vento law apply to all children and teens without a fixed, regular adequate residence including if you are staying with friends or relatives because you lost your housing, you are waiting for foster placement, or you are living in any kind of shelter, car, motel, campground, abandoned building, garage, or similar place.   


CalWORKs will pay for child care for children up to age 12, and up to age 21 if the child is disabled and needs special care. You may be eligible for child care even if you are under a CalWORKs sanction, and after you leave CalWORKs for up to two years. If you are low income, working, but did not ever get CalWORKs cash aid, you may still qualify for subsidized child care. For information call (916)369-0191. 
1. How Do I Get Child Care?
If you are receiving cash aid and participating in Welfare to Work activity with the Department of Human Assistance (DHA), ask your worker to send a Stage 1 Referral for child care, DHA will handle your child care at first. After DHA approves your case and says you are stable on aid, DHA will send your case to Child Action for Stage 2 Child Care. 
If you were on cash aid within the last 24 months and are no longer aided, you could be eligible for CAI’s Stage 2 program. If you think you are eligible, call (916) 361-0511 to apply. 
2. Choosing Quality Child Care
It is your right as a parent to choose the child care you think is best for your child. The agency will give you referrals and information on what to look for when choosing a provider. If you decide the referrals are not good choices, ask for more referrals. Choose the child care that’s best for you: 
• Child care centers, preschools, or family child care are licensed. 
• License-exempt child care can be provided by friends, relatives, or neighbors. If you use license-exempt care, you will need to file a statement that your provider meets minimal health and safety requirements. Your provider may also need to be Trustline registered (criminal background check and fingerprinting.). The child care agency will not pay for child care provided to you by someone on your CalWORKs case.  
• If the provider is caring for children from more than one family (besides their own) they may need a license. 
Most providers will have to be Trustline registered, meaning they are fingerprinted and go through a criminal background check, before they can be paid. If the provider is the child's aunt, uncle, grandmother, or grandfather, they are exempt from the Trustline registration process. 
3. What is Subsidized Child Care?
Subsidized child care is assistance to low-income families to cover all or part of their child care costs.
If you are working, enrolled in school, or participating in an approved welfare-to-work training plan, you may be eligible for financial assistance with your child care costs. There are a wide variety of programs that provide subsidized child care services for eligible families. 
Subsidized child care programs offer care for children, birth through twelve years of age. Some are full-day child care and development programs, some are part-day educational enrichment programs, and some pay for care provided by family, friends or neighbors. 
You are eligible for subsidized child care if:
• You have children under age 13 
• You are working 
• You are in a training program 
• You are going to school 
• You have a reason why you cannot care for your own children 
• Your family income meets eligibility requirements 
• You want your 3-5 year-old child to attend a state preschool 
4. How Do I Get On the Waiting List for Child Care?
Child Action, Inc. maintains a list of families who are eligible for subsidized child care programs in Sacramento County. This list is called the “Centralized Eligibility List” (or CEL). By signing up on the CEL, child care programs that meet your specified needs can access your information when they have openings in their programs.
There are two ways to apply to get on the Centralized Eligibility List (CEL):
Online: If you have access to a computer, you can submit an application through the website, 				http://sacramento.thecel.net.
Follow the instructions to begin the application process. If you fill out the application on-line, you will be able to update your own information using your log-in and password.
Phone: Call (916) 369-0191 and speak with a Child Action, Inc. Information Specialist, who will assist you with determining your eligibility and filling out the CEL application. They can mail or fax a CEL application to you, or we can help you fill out the online CEL application over the phone. 
5. How Long Will I Have to Wait Before I Get  Help?
There are thousands of eligible families that are on the Centralized Eligibility List, so there is no guarantee that you will receive financial assistance. However, the first step in receiving help paying for child care is to submit an application.
After you submit your application it is important to keep your information up-to-date. If your address, phone number, income, or family size changes it may affect your eligibility. You can update your information via the website    http://sacramento.thecel.net,  mail in an updated CEL application form (available on the website), or call a Child Action, Inc. Information Specialist at (916) 369-0191 to update your information over the phone.
6. Speaking Up for Child Care
The most effective way to make sure that there is adequate child care assistance for families is to communicate your needs to your elected officials. Parent Voices, a parent-led group, helps parents advocate and speak out on child care issues. 
For information about Parent Voices or to receive a copy of  a publication on advocacy, call Child Action, Inc. at 		(916) 369-0191 and ask for Handout #9: Speaking Up For Children. You can also ask for a grievance if you disagree with what Child Action has done in your case. If you disagree with the result of the grievance you can appeal to the State Department of Education. 
7. Child Care and Development Programs Full or part-day child care programs are available in Sacramento County for children from low-income families who need child care in order to work, attend school or participate in job training programs.

8. Becoming a Child Care Provider
If you or someone you know would like to provide child care, call Child Action, Inc. (CAI) at (916) 369-0191 for licensing, training and other information. 





Can I Get Money for Child Care?
Foster Care



Sacramento County Child Protective Services (CPS) may file a petition with the Dependency Court to have the child removed from the parent(s)' custody and placed with a relative or in a licensed foster home. Licensed foster homes receive monthly payments for each foster child placed in the home. If you are interested in becoming licensed by Sacramento County as a foster care provider, call Sacramento County Foster Home Licensing at (916) 875-5543.  Questions about foster care payments should be directed to the Department of Human Assistance, Foster Care Bureau at (916) 875-5770.   If you would like to become  a legal guardian for a child placed in your home by Sacramento County CHild Protective Services, contact the child’s social worker. Probate guardianship is available to caregivers with informal placement of their relatives’ children (though there are no cash payments tied to this type of guardianship).   If you are caring for a relative that is a dependent of the Juvenile Court, you may be eligible for foster care payments. The County refers to this as “Kinship Care”. In order to qualify for Kinship Care, relative caregivers must meet foster care licensing standards, including a criminal background check of all adults in the home. The child may be eligible only if:  • The child was placed with the caregiver by an order of the Dependency Court. 
• CPS is responsible for the child’s placement and care.
• CPS inspected and approved your home.
• The child’s parent(s) met the poverty requirements in the month that CPS first went to court or within the six months prior to that.
If the caregiver does not qualify for foster care benefits as the child’s relative, the caregiver will likely qualify for CalWORKs benefits.  Regardless of income, caregivers can receive non-needy CalWORKs benefits for the child. If caregivers are low-income, they can apply for CalWORKs benefits for themselves and the child, or add the child to a caregiver’s existing CalWORKs case. 




Foster care benefits are monthly cash aid paid by Sacramento County CPS for the child (not for the adults). The child also gets a one-time clothing allowance when the child is placed with you and another clothing allowance each year for back-to-school.	
In most counties in California, there is a higher “specialized rate” for children with severe medical and/or psychological needs. If you think your foster child qualifies for this, request an assessment from the social worker. If the child is also a Regional Center client, s/he may qualify for a  Dual Agency rate.
All children in foster care get Medi-Cal. 
2. What Are My Rights?
If you think you should be getting any of these benefits and are not, you can ask for a state hearing, or call Legal Services of Northern California at (916) 551-2150 even if you did not get a notice denying benefits. 
Every child wh is under the supervision of CPS has an attorney. Know who the attorney is and call him/her with any questions or concerns about the child’s needs. To find out who the child’s attorney is, call the Children’s Law Center of Sacramento at (916) 520-2010 or (916) 520-2050. Ask the social worker or the attorney to let you know when a court hearing is scheduled. Foster parents can attend all court hearings but cannot speak unless approved by the judge. 


















1.Kin-Gap
A relative does not have to become the legal guardian. If he or she does so, the Dependency Court case is usually closed and foster care benefits stop. If CPS recommends you become the legal guardian, ask how this will affect the benefits, and ask about Kin-GAP (Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payments Program).
To get Kin-GAP, the child must have lived with the relative for at least 6 consecutive months and the relative must become the child’s legal guardian. The relative’s home must also have been recently approved by CPS. The Dependency Court case is then closed and CPS is no longer involved. Kin-GAP is only available to caregivers who take guardianship of children placed through Dependency Court.  
Kin-GAP pays the same amount as the child received in foster care benefits. If the child was not receiving foster care benefits, Kin-GAP is paid at the basic foster care rate. Kin-GAP also may pay a yearly clothing allowance and a Kinb-GAP youth may be eligible for Independent Living Program (ILP) services.    
(800) KIN-0047 will help you identify kinship support services in any California County. If a relative gets guardianship in the probate court, the relative is eligible for CalWorks instead of Kin-Gap. 
Adoption Assistance
The Adoption Assistance Program provides benefits to adoptive families. The benefits are usually the same as the foster care amount, including higher “specialized rates”. Benefits must be renegotiated at least every two years. You may also get help with the costs of the adoption process. The adoptive family becomes legally responsible for the child’s support.

Social Security Programs



Covered workers pay for Social Security (FICA) by being taxed on the money they earn, and employers must match this amount. Social Security covers both employees and people who are self-employed.
The amount of Social Security you get depends on how much money you have earned and how many quarters you worked in a job covered by Social Security. As of 2014, a quarter is credited to your account for each $1,200 earned. You cannot earn more than 4 quarters in a year. Visit http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/QC.html for the latest coverage data.
1. Retirement Benefits
Monthly payments are made to workers and their eligible dependents, which include:
• children under 18 
• children age 18 to 19 who are full time students 
• children age 18 or over with a disability which began before age 22 
• spouses and unremarried ex-spouses who are 62 or over 
• spouses and unmarried ex-spouses caring for the worker’s children who are under 16, or for children who are disabled and entitled to benefits on the worker’s account. 
To get full retirement benefits you must be at least 65 years old. (This will gradually increase to age 67 by the year 2022). To receive reduced benefits, you must be at least 62. Persons over 65 receiving retirement benefits also get Medicare benefits. 
Present law prevents Social Security benefits going to any non-citizen who is not “lawfully present” in the U.S. (see page 65 Guide for Non-Citizens). 
You can earn money and still get retirement benefits. If you are over 65, there is no earnings limit. If you are between 62 and 65, there are limits which can be calculated at http://www.ssa.gov/planners/. The limit increases every year. If your earnings are over the limit, your retirement benefits are  reduced (by $1 for every $2 earned above the limit). These limits apply only to what you earn, not to money you get from investments, pensions, and other “unearned income.”
2. Survivor Benefits
 When a covered worker dies, monthly payments are made to eligible family: 
• A spouse over age 60 or disabled over age 50 or caring for the worker’s child who is under 16 or disabled
• The spouse above can be divorced from the worker  only if the marriage lasted at least a decade
• A disabled adult unmarried child 
A  parent of the worker over age 62 if at least 50% dependent on the worker.




If you are unable to work because of a severe illness, certified by doctors, that has lasted at least 12 months or is expected to last at least 12 months or end in death, you may be able to get Monthly Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments for yourself and eligible family members (such as a spouse, unmarried ex-spouse, child, or adult disabled child). 
For these additional family members, the amount is in addition to the worker’s benefit and there is a maximum amount that can be paid to any one family. 
When you become disabled you have several options. 
You may be entitled to State Disability Insurance (see pg. 40, Workers Rights and Unemployment  under "What If I Get Injured and Can’t Work").
However, you should also apply immediately for disability benefits under Social Security.  
You may also want to apply for SSI (pg. 56 - SSI and pg. 58 - CAPI). 
SSDI does not require low family income, but SSI does. Also, SSDI provides Medicare eligibility, while SSI provides Medi-Cal. SSDI requires that the applicant have a record of at least some wages earned during each of 20 quarters (three-month periods) of covered employment in the last 10 years before becoming disabled
SSI has no work history requirement.
Because both SSI and SSDI can take several months from application to approval, while waiting you can also apply for “Medi-Cal Only” at the welfare office. It is important not to wait until your state disability benefits have run out before applying for federal disability benefits. If you have not yet received your SSI or SSDI and your state disability benefits have run out, you should apply for General Assistance (see pg. 60).



SSI (“Supplemental Security Income”) is a cash benefit program for low-income persons 65 and over and for blind and disabled persons of any age, including infants and children. Some immigrants cannot qualify for SSI but can qualify for another program called CAPI (Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants.)
1. Basic Eligibility 
If you have enough work history you may qualify for SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance.) If you do not have enough work history you may qualify for SSI. Many people get both: if your SSDI is below the maximum SSI amount, some SSI will be added to your check to make it come up to the SSI level.
SSI may be your entire income, or it may add to other income you already get so long as your total income is not more than $20 over the SSI maximum benefit. You must be a U.S. citizen or a qualified immigrant living in the country legally to get SSI. 
To get SSI, at least one of the following must apply: 
• You are age 65 or older 
• You are blind; the vision in your best eye is no better than 20/200 with glasses or your tunnel vision is 20% or less
• Your medical records and/or examination by a doctor chosen by the state shows that your physical or mental disability can be expected to keep you, or have kept you, from working for 12 continuous months or can be expected to result in death 
• You are a child under 18 who has a medically proven “marked and severe” physical or mental disability that would keep you from working if you were an adult or significantly interfere with your daily activities. 
You cannot get SSI any month in which you are in prison or jail, in violation of parole or probation, or a fugitive from a felony. 
1.  Income  
Your “countable income” may not be above the maximum benefit level. Visit www.ssa.gov/onlineservices/#a0=3 or call (800) 772-1213 to see if you qualify. 
There are many other types of income that can be subtracted, including foster care payments and all work expenses if you are blind. For a full list, see 					http://www.ssa.gov/notices/supplemental-security-income/index.htm
2. Resources or Assets
Your countable resources may not be more than a certain amount. Some resources are not counted, including the home you live in and one car if you use it for work or medical treatment at least four times a year or if it is specially-equipped for a disabled person. There are special rules also for property used to make income, and retirement accounts.
If you have too many resources, you can spend them down to meet the limits. You could buy things you need (as long as whatever you buy does not make you go over another limit), or pay off  debts. If you give away  resources or sell them below a fair price, you can be ineligible for SSI for up to 36 months.
If a child eligible for SSI lives with a parent (or parents) not eligible for SSI, a portion of the parent’s income and resources may be used to figure the child’s SSI cash aid. If a person eligible for SSI lives with a spouse not eligible for SSI, a portion of the spouse’s income and resources may be used to figure the  SSI cash aid.  The Social Security Office can explain the complicated rules and figure the benefit. For more information, visit www.ssa.gov/onlineservices/#a0=3 or call (800) 772-1213. 
Food: If you get SSI in California, you cannot get CalFresh (food stamps).  However, if you live where meals cannot be prepared you can get additional financial help each month (ask for the Restaurant Meals Allowance.) 
Health Care: If you receive SSI, you automatically qualify for Medi-Cal without a share of cost. You may also be eligible for In-Home Supportive Services. (See page 32)
Special Telephone Equipment: If your disability makes it difficult to use the phone you may qualify for special equipment to help. Call (800) 806-1191 (voice) or 		(800) 806-4474 (TTY line.)
Rent and Household Expenses: Benefits will be lower if you live with someone else and do not pay your full share of household expenses. Homeless people receive the same cash aid as persons with homes, except that you can only get SSI 6 months out of 9 if living in a “public shelter”. If you were getting free room and board when you applied for SSI and later begin paying your share for room and board, tell your worker so your benefits will increase.
A single person can get a board & care rate called “Nonmedical Out of Home Care,” if you do not receive In Home Supportive Services, are not staying in your own home, and a relative who does not get SSI is providing you room, food, and personal care. The county must certify the private residence.
You may be able to get an immediate payment from the Social Security office if either your SSI or your Social Security check is late and you need money right away. 



See page 58 Social Security Offices.  Come in, or call		(800) 772-1213 to make an appointment. Even if the process from application to first check takes months, when you are approved the benefits will be paid beginning with when you started the application. Do not accept a verbal denial. Insist on filing at least a partial application. If you do not have all the necessary information, you can give additional or corrected information later. 
TTY Number for hearing impaired      (800) 325-0778. 
If you have difficulty with English or with hearing, the Social Security Office will provide you with an interpreter without cost. You may have help from  a friend, family member or advocate at any appointment.  If your condition makes getting to the office difficult, you may ask for a telephone interview. 
If you want to sign a form allowing someone else to serve as your  representative, ask by phone for form SSA-1696 to be mailed to you. Parents or guardians can apply for a child under age 18 who is blind or who has a disability.
You will need to provide:
• Social Security card or record of number 
• birth certificate or other proof of age
• rent or mortgage information
• payroll slips, bank books, insurance policies, car registration, burial fund records 
• names, addresses and telephone numbers of doctors hospitals and clinics that have treated them (if applying for SSI because of disability or blindness) 
• proof of U.S. citizenship or eligible noncitizen status 
You should apply even if they don’t have all the things listed. The Social Security Office can help you get whatever is needed. 
Your case will be sent to a state agency under contract with SSA to obtain your medical records and decide whether you meet the medical requirements for eligibility to benefits. In general, people who are blind or have very obvious disabilities are approved more quickly than those who must have their disabilities more extensively verified. 
If the state  decides that you are not disabled enough to get SSI, you can appeal. 
If necessary, you can apply for General Assistance while you wait for SSI approval. Ask if  the county will help you get SSI while you are on General Assistance.
If you get a notice that you have been overpaid, and you believe it is not your fault, insist on immediately submitting a “Request for Waiver of Overpayment.”
If you believe that your SSI check or any notice that you get is wrong, insist on immediately submitting a “Request for Reconsideration”. Legal Services (see pg. 70) and advocacy organizations can help you best after you insist on these forms to protect your rights. There are also private attorneys who help with disability cases. 
Also, some Congressional district offices have free experts at Social Security Casework. Call yours and ask for  help with a  hearing or complaint. 







The Social Security Administration must mail you a notice of any changes in your benefits.  If you disagree with the proposed action, request a “Reconsideration” immediately by going  to  the  Social Security office and filling out a “Request for Reconsideration” form . Make sure that you get a copy of the form stamped by Social Security with the date it was filed. The form is also available online at www.ssa.gov. 
If you request a Reconsideration within the time period given on the notice (usually 10 days), your benefits can continue unchanged until you receive a decision.   If they paid you too much, and they want to take money out of your check, you can request a waiver if it wasn’t your fault and if it would be hard for you to pay the money back. Ask Social Security for the waiver form. 
In SSDI cases, you must fill out a separate form asking for your aid to continue. This is called “payment continuation.”  If you miss the deadline given in the notice, the aid will be cut or reduced, but you still have 60 days from the date you received the notice to request a Reconsideration.  After 60 days, if you have “Good Cause” for missing the deadline, you may be allowed to file a Reconsideration.  If you win the Reconsideration, your lost benefits will be paid back to you.  
There are three types of Reconsideration: case review, informal, or formal conference.  However, if your application for SSDI or SSI is denied for medical reasons, you can usually only get a case review.  
If your reconsideration or waiver is denied, you may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) with the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR).  At the hearing you may  appear in person, submit new evidence, examine the evidence used in making the determination or decision under review, and present and question witnesses.  The ALJ who holds the hearing may ask you questions.  He or she will write a decision based on the hearing record.  If you waive your right to appear at the hearing, the ALJ will make a decision based on the evidence that is already in the file.
When you are receiving SSI or SSDI and then start working, your benefits could be cut if you are working and earning too much. (This is known as “Substantial Gainful Activity” or “SGA”). 10 days after you get the tentative notice, a notice that your payments will stop will be sent to you. Request a reconsideration immediately. To protect yourself, it is best to make a new application at the same time you request a Reconsideration. 
If you are considering going back to work, know your rights.  Call Protection and Advocacy Services at (800) 776-5746 and ask for their booklet, “Disability and Work.”

What is CAPI?           
Cash Assistance Program for  Immigrants (“CAPI”) is a cash benefit  program for low-income people who are aged 65 and older, are blind, or who have a disability that meet the general eligibility requirements for SSI but are not eligible for SSI because of their immigration status. (See pg. 65 “What Benefits Are Available to Immigrants”)
CAPI benefit amounts are similar to SSI ($10 less for one person, $20 less for a  couple). Like SSI, benefits are lower if you share housing or don’t pay your full share of household expenses.
If you are eligible for CAPI you may also be eligible for Medi-Cal, Food Stamps and In Home Supportive Services but you will need to apply for these separately.
To get CAPI, you must first attempt to get SSI (see the Social Security offices below.) If you are turned down for SSI only because of your immigration status, you may qualify for CAPI.

Can I Get Veterans’ Services?        
General Assistance
Can I Get General Assistance?        
General Assistance (GA) is a program for people who have almost no money at all and don’t qualify for unemployment benefits, CalWORKs or Social Security Programs. GA has a lot of rules and doesn’t provide much money .
1. Residence 
To qualify for GA, you must reside in Sacramento County for at least 15 days and intend to remain here. 
2. Cash and Resource Limits 
You cannot have more than a certain amount in cash or in a bank account when you apply. However, you can own the following resources, as long as they do not exceed the maximum limits. For current limits, visit http://www.dha.saccounty.net/benefits/Pages/default.aspx#ga or call (916) 874-2063. 
• Car(s)
• Personal property
• Necessary household furnishings and tools and supplies needed for rehabilitation or self-sufficiency.
• The house you live in.
If you live with your spouse, his or her income will be counted in deciding if you are eligible, unless your spouse receives SSI. 
3. Time Limits 
If you are able to work, DHA will classify you as “employable.”  If you are “employable,” you can only receive GA for 3 months in any 12-month period. 
If you are unable to work, DHA will classify you as “unemployable” and you will not have a time limit.


1. Basic Benefits
GA benefits provide monthly cash aid in Sacramento County. In addition to the cash aid, a bus pass is provided. 
Once approved, you can earn up to money each month with no loss of benefits. 
Go to the DHA office to apply for GA. Not all DHA offices take GA applications. (see pg. 68 for DHA Offices).
Be prepared for a long day, but remember that you have the right to apply. Tell the worker at DHA that you need GA. You will have to fill out an application. Bring with you identification and papers that prove your income, resources and citizenship (your birth certificate is best but other documents can work). If you are an immigrant bring documents that indicate your status.

Every GA applicant has a right to request “expedited” CalFesh (food stamps) (see pg. 13 - Emergency Food Stamps).
If you are eligible, DHA must issue you food stamps within three days of your application if you are eligible to receive expedited food stamps. 
Make sure that your worker has a good address for you; otherwise, you may miss important notices from DHA. Your home address and mailing address do not have to be the same.  If you are homeless, you can use the DHA address to pick up your mail,  but if you do, you must check your mail once a week. Some community organizations and shelters provide free mail service. 
You must be helped if you are in the office before it closes. If you need help immediately, you should receive it. If anyone does not let you apply or tells you to come back the next day, insist on speaking to a worker, and then a supervisor, and then the deputy director, if necessary.
The county has 30 calendar days to approve your case and issue you GA benefits. Your benefits will be issued to you on an Electronic Benefits Transfer (“EBT”) card.   When your EBT card is issued to you, you will also select a personal identification number (“PIN”).  Using your EBT card and your PIN, you can access your benefits through any ATM. Your DHA worker should provide you with a list of ATMs in the area.  This list will let you know which ATMs are free and which ones charge a fee.
2. If You Think You Are Unable to Work
If you are disabled you may want to apply for SSI first (see pg. 26 - SSI). You may apply for GA while you wait on SSI. You can ask the county to help you apply for SSI. If you get GA because you are unemployable you must apply for SSI.
If you are disabled, apply for GA as “unemployable”. You should bring any medications, prescriptions, private doctor’s statement, or other proof about your disability.  
If DHA decides that you can work, you can appeal. 
Make sure you go to all appointments because you may be denied GA if you don’t.
3. If You Need Special Assistance 
DHA must help if you need it. If you cannot read or write, they must help you with their forms. If you have a mental disability, they must refer you to a mental health worker for evaluation. The evaluation can establish you as a Needs Special Assistance (“NSA”) recipient.  NSA recipients are approved for GA promptly.  In addition, “NSA” participants are protected from some sanctions, work and other program requirements, and denials of aid.
If you request an evaluation by a mental health worker, but do not get one, you may demand that you be classified as “medically unemployable” for 30 days. You will be exempt from work requirements until you get a mental health evaluation. 
4. Emergency Money
If you have an emergency you may be able to get some money right away. This is called “immediate need.”  Ask DHA about this. If they do not help you, call Legal Services (pg. 70).

 
1. If You Are Able to Work 
If you are employable, you will be required to attend job training. 
2. If You Are Classified “Unemployable”
If DHA says you are disabled, you will not need to go to job training  When you are no longer disabled, you will need to go to job training and your GA will be limited to 3 months in each 12-month period. 
3. Reports 
You are required to report all changes within five (5) days. In addition, you must fill out a QR-7 report every third month. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! On the quarterly report, you will be asked to report your income, property and household composition.  You will also be required to report any changes in your income, property or household composition. 
If you get the form in the mail, you must fill it out and return it to the DHA office by the 5th day of the month. You should get a report form before or on the first day of the month. If you don’t get it in the mail, you may call the automated phone system at (916) 874-3100 to request a form be mailed, or go to the DHA office to complete the form. 
Make sure to get a receipt showing the time and date you submitted the form. If your QR-7 gets lost, or you do not turn it in, your case will be terminated at the end of the month. 
1. Hearings 
If your case is going to be terminated or your benefits are reduced, you have a right to a GA hearing. You must request the hearing within 10 days of the action. The County must hand-issue you a “Notice of Action” seven (7) days before a hearing or 8 days if mailed. The date and time of the hearing will appear on the notice. Your benefits cannot be cut off or reduced without a hearing unless you do not go to the hearing (see Pg. 62 “Hearings and Complaints”).
2. Penalties
If you do not go to your GA hearing, or you lose your GA hearing, your case will be terminated (with or without a sanction) or your benefits will be reduced. If you receive a sanction and you have not been sanctioned in the past 365 days you can re-apply at once. If this is the second sanction in a year, you can re-apply in 30 days. After the third penalty in a year, you have to wait 60 days to re-apply. 
3. If You Begin to Get SSI
GA is a “loan” from the county.  If you begin to receive SSI, the amount you received on GA will be automatically deducted from your first SSI check. 
4. After Time Limits
If your General Assistance is stopped due to the time limits: 
• You can continue to get food stamps.
• You can continue to receive free and low cost health care under the Affordable Care Act.
If you become “unemployable” while you are timed off of GA, reapply for GA and provide verification that you are “unemployable.” If they find you are unemployable, you will be eligible to once again receive GA and you will not be subject to time limits. Bring proof of unemployability with you to your assessment meeting.

Guide for Non-Citizens
What Benefits Are Available To   Immigrants?       
Immigrants can get many kinds of help from the government even if they don’t have a “green card.” For help with other immigration and citizenship issues see the list of agencies at the end of the chapter on pg. 66.
1. Benefits Available To All Immigrants
All immigrants, including those without documents, can qualify for the following kinds of help:
Health Care: Prenatal Care; Emergency Medi-Cal; Minor Consent Medi-Cal; Regional Centers; California Children’s Service;  CHDP and Immunizations for kids.
Food Programs: WIC; School Breakfast & Lunch; Help from food pantries.
Other Help: Help from Shelters; Public Education; and services from many non-profit agencies.
These programs don’t have immigration requirements and if you are undocumented, you may qualify.  You do not need to tell anyone that you or anyone else who lives with you are undocumented.  Your workers do not need to ask about your immigration status if you are not getting benefits for yourself.  If they do ask you, simply tell them that you are a “not qualified” immigrant (“not qualified” is not the same as undocumented).  That is all they need to know. 
If a school or child care center asks for your social security number on a form, you can write “none” on the form or leave it blank. They may not give the information on that form to a government agency.
2. Victims of Trafficking, Domestic Violence, and Other Serious Crimes
California law provides eligible non-citizens who are victims of trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes access to benefits equal to those available for refugees.
• Victims of trafficking may qualify before they are certified by the federal government as victims. 
• Victims of domestic violence and other serious crimes may qualify once they have applied for a U visa/interim relief.
• You do not need a social security number to apply.
3. Benefits Available To Lawfully Present Immigrants
Most lawfully present immigrants, such as legal permanent residents, refugees, asylees, and persons granted withholding of deportation, can get CalFresh (food assistance) benefits, CalWORKS, General Assistance, County healthcare, Housing Assistance,  and Medi-Cal. If they have a sponsor, the sponsor’s income may count as part of their income for five years. 
Refugees who have been in the country less than 8 months and persons who were granted asylum less than 8 months before,  can also be eligible for Refugee Cash Assistance (generally this is for able bodied adults without children. Victims of trafficking may also qualify for Refugee Cash Assistance once they receive certification. Call the local DHA office listed on page 68.
Social Security: If you are a non-citizen who has paid into the Social Security system as a worker or had money taken out of your paycheck for this program, you may qualify for Social Security disability, retirement or survivor benefits (see Social Security, pg. 56). 
SSI: If you are a low-income non-citizen in the U.S. who has a disability is blind, or over 65 years old, you can get SSI if: 
• You were lawfully residing in the U.S. on August 22, 1996, and are blind or disabled. 
• You are a refugee, asylee or were granted withholding of deportation/removal, but only during the seven years after getting this status. 
• You are a current or veteran U.S. military personnel 
• You are a lawful permanent resident with credit for 40 quarters (about 10 years) of work in the U.S. There are special rules in which quarters worked by your spouse or parents may count; ask the worker.
 CAPI: If you are an immigrant who has a disability, is blind or 65 years old or older and you are not eligible for SSI because of your immigration status, you may be able to get CAPI (Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants). See page 58. 
Translation: If you speak limited English and you need to apply for government benefits, Department of Human Assistance and the Social Security Administration must provide you with an interpreter or connect you to a telephone interpreter service, at no cost to you.  



Regardless of your immigration status, you have the right to receive minimum wage, overtime and safe working conditions.  You also have the right to be free from harassment and discrimination.  If your rights as a worker are being violated, contact the state Labor Commissioner’s Office at  (916) 263-1811 to complain. If you have legal work papers, it is illegal for employers to commit on-the-job discrimination, or deny a job because a worker is from another country.  
You can also get help from the Voluntary Legal Services Program Employment Law Clinic. Call (916) 551-2102 for information.



1. What Is Public Charge?
If you are applying to become a lawful permanent resident (green card holder) and you are using health care programs (such as Medi-Cal , In Home Supportive Services, or Healthy Families) or CalFresh, it will not hurt your chances of getting your green card by making you a "public charge".   You might have a problem getting your green card if you have used cash welfare or long-term care (like a nursing home) depending on your situation. Cash aid for your children or other family members will not effect your immigration status unless it is your family’s only income. 
Officials will look at many factors, including your age, your health, your entire family’s (or sponsor’s) income and resources to determine whether in the future you will be likely to need to rely on cash welfare to live.  Past use of cash benefits may not count against you, for example if it was several years ago that you received the benefits or if it was only for a short period of time.
You do not have to worry about public charge if you already have a green card (unless you leave the US for more than 6 months at a time and try to re-enter), or if you are applying for citizenship, are a refugee or asylee, or are applying for a green card based on having lived in the US since before 1972.
Victims of domestic violence who file a self-petition under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) are subject to the "public charge" test. However, they can use all benefits, including cash welfare, without affecting this decision.
The government should not demand that you repay any welfare you correctly received as a condition of giving you legal status.  If this happens, call one of the immigrant advocate agencies. 
2. Sponsors
Most new immigrants entering into the U.S. through family members are required to have a sponsor sign an “affidavit of support” form.  This form is a promise to the government that the sponsor will help to provide economic support for any sponsored immigrants.  
If you are a sponsored immigrant and you want to apply for certain government benefits, your sponsor’s income and resources may be added to yours in determining your eligibility for benefits (this is called “deeming”).  This deeming rule makes the income of many immigrants too high to qualify for benefits.  There is no deeming if you are applying for health care programs, only for CalFresh and cash assistance programs.  
Deeming does not apply to some immigrants, including: refugees, asylees, parolees, victims of domestic violence who have filed a “self-petition” for an immigrant visa, or certain other immigrants who are not required to have a sponsor.  In addition, some programs have exception for very low income persons called “indigence exceptions”. The rules for there are different for each program. Ask about this when you apply.
If you have a question or problem with “sponsor deeming” contact one of the agencies listed at the end of this page.


If you are arrested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):
• You should emain silent, or tell the ICE agent that you want to remain silent. • Ask to speak with a lawyer. Do not sign any documents without first speaking with a lawyer.     • Do not carry false documents. • Find out the name and phone number of a reliable immigration attorney and keep this information with you at all times. • Know your "A" number (alien registration number) if you have one, and write it down someplace at home where your family members know where to find it. • Prepare a form or document that authorizes another adult to care for your minor children. • Advise family members who do not want to be questioned by ICE to stay away from the place where you are being detained.

Hearings and Complaints

If your CalFresh, CalWORKs, Medi-Cal, In Home Supportive Services or CAPI benefits are reduced or stopped by the welfare office and you don’t agree, you should file for a fair hearing with the California Department of Social Services.
In a fair hearing, you will have a chance to explain what happened to you, and after hearing your side and the welfare office’s side, an impartial referee will decide who wins. If someone calls you and says that you don’t have a case, continue to insist on a hearing until you have received adequate legal advice.
You must be sent a written notice 10 days before any action is taken that will reduce or stop your benefits. The notice must explain clearly the reasons for the action. If you disagree with this action and you formally request a fair hearing before the date the action takes effect, then under most circumstances your aid will not be cut until the hearing (unless it ends for another reason, like your certification period ended).
If you do not ask for a fair hearing before the date the action takes place, your aid may be reduced or cut, but you still may fight the action if you ask for the hearing within 90 days of the date the notice was mailed. Save the envelope your notice came in and a copy of your fair hearing request so you will have proof that you met the required deadline. You can ask for a hearing after that if you have a good reason for filing late.
To request the fair hearing, you may fill out and return the form on the back of the notice or write a letter doing so in your own words.   
You can also request the hearing by calling the toll-free number set up for this purpose, (800) 952-5253. You should call early; they open at 7:30 AM. The line is often busy, so keep trying. Remember to write down the name of the person you spoke with.
You cannot make a hearing request with your worker or any other County staff. You must either call the 800 number or send the written request to the Appeals and State Hearing section.
The state will send you a notice  with the date, time, and place of your hearing.  Usually, this happens within 3 or 4 weeks. Currently, in the CalFresh program, anytime before the hearing, you can request a delay (“postponement”) of the hearing in order to have more time to prepare or to get an attorney or advocate. In other aid programs, or to get a second postponement, you must have a very good reason  (“good cause”).
You may be called or get a letter from the county hearings representative assigned to your case. The hearings representative  will be presenting the county’s side at the hearing. The hearings representative will also write up the county’s side at least 2 days before the hearing. You have the right to get a copy of the county’s position statement. If the hearings representative does not have it ready for you to see before the hearing, you may request that the hearing be postponed to give you the chance to read the statement. This postponement does not count against you.
The hearings representative may offer to settle your case. This is called a conditional withdrawal. Think about this carefullly. If you agree with what the county is offering, you can accept the conditional withdrawal. If not, you can reject it and go to the hearing. You can also try to negotiate for a deal that you like.
If you are disabled, or homebound, hearings can be held by phone, at the welfare office or in your home, but you must ask for this in your hearing request.
You must also be provided with an interpreter for the hearing at no cost if English is not your first language. 
After your hearing, call the toll-free number and complain if the state takes longer than 60 days to get a decision about food stamps, or 90 days if the hearing was about CalWORKs or Medi-Cal. These are usually the maximum amounts of time that are permitted to decide such cases (starting on the date of your request for hearing). If your hearing decision takes longer than 90 days and you have never continued it, you must get extra money for the delay, if the decision is granted in your favor.
If you do not win the hearing and you are still convinced you are right, you can request a rehearing, within 30 days or file an appeal in court within 1 year.
More Advice:
For hearings about GA or County health care in Sacramento County, you have only 10 days to request a hearing with the County. The back of the Notice of Action should tell you how to ask for a hearing. 
Seek advice and assistance. Talk to a legal worker or a well-informed friend or community person about your situation. 
Keep good records and save all papers that an agency gives or mails to you. Write down the name and time of anyone you speak with in person or over the phone and the time you had the conversation.
You have a right to see your case file and to copy anything you need in it. You have a right to see any regulations or instructions that apply to your situation.
If you are disabled, the law says that the welfare office must help you, so ask for help you need when you request a hearing. If you are treated unfairly because of a disability or health problem, send a complaint letter to the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Dept. of Justice, P.O. Box 66118, Washington DC 20035-6118.

People’s Guide to
HEALTH, WELFARE AND OTHER SERVICES
ABOUT THE GUIDE
The People’s Guide is not a directory, but a self-advocacy tool to give homeless and low-income people an active role in making a difference in their own lives. The emphasis of the Guide is improving the information for homeless and low-income people to better access health care, housing, food, income, legal advice and employment from local, state and federal programs and community services in Sacramento County. 


We all know that we live in hard times. Wages are not keeping up with increasing rents, leading to overcrowding and homelessness. Government budgets at all levels are either eliminating or making drastic cuts to human service budgets that are discussed in this Guide. Now more than ever, we need a guide for the people of Sacramento to advocate for themselves in order to access the programs that will help them through these difficult times.
